Review
"My wife had hip surgery in May 2021 and has been doing physical therapy at Benchmark with Anthony.  Anthony is caring, knowledgeable and has helped her progress back to walking with a cane following the surgery.  She started with a walker following the surgery and has made excellent progress with Anthony's help and encouragement.  The entire staff is friendly and helpful with insurance and scheduling.  The facility is clean, neat and conducive to working on  therapy exercises.  They care about their patients and work diligently to tailor the therapy sessions to the well being of each person.  We feel a sincere caring."
"Working with Anthony to strengthen my back and knees was amazing . Very professional , knowledgeable and got me to my desired goal. He was always willing to help and provided me with tools I needed to continue my journey at home. Highly recommended"
Great experience at Benchmark with P/T on plantar fascitis; worked with Anthony and several other therapists for approx. 2 months and now I am pain free. Highly recommend!
"Very knowleable, professonal across the board. Under the leadershƒ±p of Anthony the staff goes above and beyond by placƒ±ng the needs of clƒ±ent above all else. If would hƒ±ghly recommd thƒ±s locatƒ±on to my famƒ±ly and frƒ±ends."
"Great team, very welcoming and knowledgeable. My therapist Anthony was patient and very helpful. If I ever need PT again, this will be the place to go. Strongly recommending BenchMark and this location."
"The staff was friendly, knowledgeable got me physically where I needed to be. Kudos!!!!"
"Professional atmosphere. Staff are very competent, friendly, and streamline your physical therapy tailored to you!"
Imagine going to heaven without dying. This explains BenchMark perfectly. The whole staff really makes you feel at home and really cares about your issues. They really pay attention to every detail of your recovery no matter how big or small. The front desk staff is also very accommodating and welcoming. They treat you with respect and courtesy. Would recommend 1000%
I am so glad I chose Benchmark to do my rehab. I had a torn labrum from a weightlifting accident. The doctor told me it would take a year to fully recover. 2 Days after the surgery I was at Benchmark starting PT. Only 5 months later I was back to doing all my normal movements throughout the day. Now it‚Äôs been 7 months and I‚Äôm back in the gym lifting weights like normal. I‚Äôm so thankful for Benchmark and the care they provided. I highly recommend this place. And Sarah Roberts deserves a promotion! She‚Äôs the best!
"I have lived in many states and had lots of physical therapy over the years.  This is the best of all of them.  A great staff of well educated therapists, assistants who are there to add support and a front desk that not only handle appointments, but who help you deal with insurance.  If therapy is prescribed  this is the place to go."
Great staff and office! Could not have asked for a better PT than Sarah she is great at what she does and always caring.Staff Morgan and Maheen making you feel like home always going above and beyond to make your therapy is easy and comfortable. Have seen n feel so much improvement on my shoulder with the PT I have received from Sarah!
Outstanding office staff! They have treated me and my family exceptionally well in the time I‚Äôve spent here!
Wonderful Docs! who take away the pain and the office staff are fantastic. I can't recommend them highly enough.
"Since coming here, I've really seen some improvement with my pain."
The place is extremely clean and the atmosphere is very upbeat. Yele and Lance both pushed me hard but never overdid it.  Both therapists were very caring and listened to my needs. I would definitely recommend this facility and will choose to go back should there be a need. üòÉ
From the first phone call until I left this morning I have been treated with the best care I could ever ask for. The first time I walked in the door my pain level was at least a 9 and I am now at a 2. I have been given the tools I need to continue to improve.  I would definitely recommend this practice and I will definitely use them again if the need arises. Thank you Yele for helping me get back to some normalcy in life.
"Multiple strategies, always cheerful, highly skilled.  Experienced at PT and Yele (prounounced yell ee) keeps your spirits up and challenges you.  Grateful to have found a SAFE, CLEAN and empathetic place close to home.  I am stronger than I have been in years.  I look forward to my sessions.  Over time I have gained a lot."
the therapist is great he knows what he is doing. I have come a long way since I have been going there. after falling 36ft off of a roof I had 9 broken bones and he help me learn how to walk again. I can't feel my left foot and I thought it was going to be so hard to walk on it because in my mind I was like how do you walk on something you cannot feel? but sure enough he showed me a few simple things and the next week it was no problem. then he helped strengthen both feet and legs. now that he has approval he is helping strengthen my core to take some of the weight off my spine where I had surgery twice
"I was in a car accident that injured my neck and shoulders. I started with Pain of 7 out of 10. I was extremely limited in range of motion in my neck with constant muscle spasms in my shoulders.  After the care of my therapist, Yele, I was able to leave physical therapy comfortably  with minimum to no pain. Kim always assured that I had appointments, since I would drive an hour from work. 5 stars is the least I could do for the Bremen Benchmark staff. Thank you!"
My experience at BenchMark was wonderful. The staff is very professional and friendly. If I have to have therapy again this will be my choice. Keep Up The Good Work. Thank you
"I am writing this review on behalf of my father, Lanny Aldridge.  My dad was referred to Benchmark Physical Therapy with Dr. Omidina Yele following hip replacement at Emory.  My dad had not walked prior to this without the assistance of a cane and or walker.  He had been unable to walk for the last 2.5 years.  After the 5th visit with Dr. Yele, my dad was walking.  Our family is so thankful for the therapy he is receiving from Benchmark Physical Therapy in Bremen.  Dr. Yele is a blessing!"
"Highly recommend
Two knee replacements
The best possible outcomes fir both.
Thank you Benchmark"
"‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Because 5 Stars don‚Äôt do them justice. Love these guys!!!!! They are awesome!!!!! I have been going through a roller coaster of emotions with my accident and they were right there every step of the way to help with my recovery process. Yele and Kim are so friendly, professional and always have such upbeat personalities. They are an asset to the West Georgia area. Thank you so much guys for everything."
"This place is awesome! The staff is super cheerful, and willing to help out when needed. I feel relaxed and at ease every time I leave my appointment. I highly recommend!!!"
"Love the way they treat their clients. We are not just clients, but family.  Great with children as well as adults. From day one, I have felt safe and secure with their work. This location is a blessing to anyone in Wedt Ga that needs PT."
This is actually Jessica Barron . I have never had pt before and was never nervous the dr and his staff made me feel right at home and now and the end of my pt I actually feel amazing which I didn‚Äôt think was possible highly recommend the Bremen office !!!
The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.
"I've been to PT before. It was boring. I really felt as if I was just throwing money away. ATI is the complete opposite. The therapists and staff are simply amazing! They are kind, fun, energetic, and knowledgeable. I have never looked forward to PT, but I do now!"
Great hospitality and definitely make it a fun time while helping you recover! If there were 100 stars on here I‚Äôd give them 1000!
The staff and leadership are very knowledgeable and does a great job of teaching you how to become effective in your own training and development. They partner with you to get you healed and teach you how to recognize when and if the problem may occur again. Love them so much!
They are very friendly & kind there. They see if you‚Äôre ok with your exercises in everything. I love it there
"The Therapist I have worked with exclusively has been Richard. He has been awesome to work with and pushes me but does take into consideration my overall pain level from  previous surgeries that has left me with chronic pain. The room and equipment is constantly being cleaned! Overall rating is definitely a *10+ I‚Äôve also worked with another girl several times and she really pushes me to improve which I like!

This past week has definitely had its challenges.. flat tire and husband is disabled and couldn‚Äôt change the tire!"
"Amazing therapist that are very courteous!!! Everyone works together to help the patients. The atmosphere is awesome! Everyone seems to love what they do and love working with each other! Not only that, the therapy is working!"
Very flexible with school schedule!  My daughter feels like she is going to see her friends rather than a therapist. Great professionals who take the time to explain everything that they are doing. Getting my daughter better!!!
Trussville ATI Physical Therapy is absolutely wonderful! All the therapists and staff are so caring and really go the extra mile to help you.
Always friendly and knowledgeable at what their doing
The best Therapists you will find. With their knowledge & pooling of information & modalities I have a chance to avoid surgery! Thanks Team ATI!
Great staff and very knowledgeable. Your success is their primary goal.
"I love these guys, they always get me back in action pretty quick."
Always fantastic service and results.  Wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else to keep me in the game.
"The physical therapists and office staff at ATI have been wonderful. Knowledgeable, patient, friendly and authentically caring. I highly recommend this organization if you are in need of physical therapy."
The program they put me on is helping me with my condition. I would recommend them to everyone.
My physical therapist Richard is amazing. I will definitely recommend him in you come into the North Trussville ATI Therapy location.
"They are very nice and friendly but emtirely to many patients per Therapist. They get things confused, forget about where you are in your activities, evaluation is very unclear and no clear instructions on what to do on your own once you leave."
Physical Therapy with Richard has really improved my range of motion. He takes his time to make sure that I get back to 100% in record timing.
"Can‚Äôt say enough good about the team at ATI Happy Hollow!! The PTs are knowledgeable, personable, hilarious, kind, and everything you could want in a physical therapy experience. Thanks to Beth, Alyssa, Kelton, Brian, Kacy (and Ryan!) for all their hard work and fun times!"
My daughter goes and she's 15 and she üíò üíò love them
"I would recommend ATI physical therapy to my friends and family.  The staff is courteous and understanding.  Everyone is friendly.  The place is clean and organized.  IF I ever have to have therapy again, I will be using ATI."
"I came here after my first surgery and was very nervous and quiet for the first few weeks but eventually I opened up and got to know all the workers and they are all amazing! Not only do they care about the patients and know what to do for every injury, they are also very kind and know how to make you laugh especially Ryan, Brian, and Kacy! I couldn‚Äôt recommend this place more 10/10!"
"If I could give 10 stars I would do it. This place is amazing, Brian, Casey, Ryan and the rest of the team are the best. They truly care about their patients, and no matter how busy they are, they are always so nice and do their jobs with a smile on their faces."
I have never had a positive experience with physical therapy until I began treatment at this location with Brian.  It is obvious he is very experienced and cares about his patients.  They don‚Äôt just give you simple exercises you can do on your own in the gym; but tailer a program where you will see results.
"Best physical therapy place I have been too and has the nicest and most helpful people like Brain, Casey, and Ryan they help you a lot and make your physical therapy experience much better."
"Well the care may be good, but the fact you get put on hold and we will call you back SUCK""s, i am looking for my wife as we speak and can not find her, via cell phone or ATI answering service,  her appointment was at 4:30 it is now 6:48pm. I am not happy."
Great experience!! Tracie was awesome!! Kim is great too!!! Very dedicated to getting you back on the right track
Very nice and hard working!
Big b the brinator is excellent everyone there is top notch everyone is great highly recommend
They are great here. They really care about your recovery and getting you back to were you need to be
Recommend for fast recovery and there is a little fun

































"I am updating this review because it did not load the reason why I gave 5 stars!
James is most definitely dedicated and caring.  He familiarized himself with the protocol laid out by the doctor and explained every step of the way so we/my husband knew the timeline and what to expect during each step of progression.  You hear so often how someone is attentive and caring toward their patients. Well, James and the staff here are more than attentive. They are all in, dedicated, and getting to know everyone on a comfortable, personal level. In my option, that is what makes therapy a plan designed for each individual.  You could not ask for a better place to be!  We are so grateful for them!"
"James and his team at Benchmark were incredibly personable, professional and supportive. I can‚Äôt recommend them enough. My range of motion and pain levels have improved greatly thanks to their hard work and dedication."
"I went here for therapy on a severe broken left leg, not only did they get my leg back to almost 100% in a fairly short time but you gain much more, you gain a group of friends. Dr.James, Dr.Katlyn yall awesome thank yall so much"
"I had trouble with my right shoulder and BENCHMARK PT in Albany/Leesburg Ga helped me recover so I could get back to work.The staff here were outstanding in help,patience and kindness.One couldn't ask for a better place to receive treatment.I hope I never need treatment in the future,but if I do,I hope I have the privilege of returning to BENCHMARK in Albany/Leesburg Ga."
We feel so blessed to have found Dr. Blackwell and Alexis during my time of need. He explains things about the surgeries that I ordinarily would not have known. A very attentive and compassionate doctor has made my physical therapy something to look forward to.  I highly recommend this practice to anyone in need of physical therapy.
"Very great place, great group of people/friends they make you feel at home while getting you back as close to your old self as before your injury, a big plus is that they joke and talk with you instead of just demanding you do this and that"
"Good atmosphere for therapy,  built my confidence and encouraged me to want to work harder. Will definitely go back...."
"A wonderful place to go for physical therapy. The staff there is awesome. I wouldn‚Äôt go any other place. They are very helpful and friendly. That‚Äôs what make the process much better.. James is very professional,knowledgeable and helpful.They worked around my busy schedule they are awesome.."
The staff was awesome! They were very knowledgable and helpful! I would recommend them to others!
Highly recommend this place. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They‚Äôre also very flexible when there is a need to reschedule appointments which is probably convenient for most people! They‚Äôre amazing.
"I‚Äôve been going to Benchmark Physical Therapy for some time now, and have nothing but fantastic things to say! James is extremely professional, knowledgeable and friendly. He treats each patient with care and is focused on their progress. From my first appointment, both James and Alexis have been friendly and warm and make every appointment something to look forward to!

I have noticed a positive and drastic change in the progress of my hamstring injury, and I firmly and undoubtedly believe that is because of Jame‚Äôs hard work and thorough understanding of recovery!"
Staff and Therapist at Benchmark are excellent... friendly and caring. Dr. Blackwell takes plenty of time explaining everything about your situation and what he is doing. He is very patient and encouraging .  We highly recommend this Therapist!
"I can honestly say that the staff at BENCHMARK PHYSICAL THERAPY are very caring and full of empathy. They are professional and genuine in caring for their patients. I am soooo glad I was referred to BENCHMARK. They gave me hope when I was discouraged. I LOVE MY FAMILY AT BENCHMARK because that‚Äôs how they make u feel, ‚ÄúJUST LIKE FAMILY‚Äù."
I wish I was better with words so I could really say just how much I appreciate James at BenchMark therapy. James is very good at what he does. After having a hip joint replaced James now has me back to walking normally again. James is very passionate about his therapy and listens to what you have to say. He is a real pleasure to be around.
James and Alexis is so caring and helpful in every way possible!! James helps with concussion and thankfully because of the brain exercises and his knowledge I have no symptoms now.
"James is very professional. He cares about his patients and makes getting healthy fun!!! Alexis is such a great help, too. I highly recommend benchmark physical therapy :)"
"Dr. James is a wonderful physical therapist to work with. He displays a high level of patience, understanding and empathy each session. He is very attentive and asks the right questions to help steer you on the road to recovery. Alexa is amazing as well, both are positive and great motivators during each visit.  I would highly recommend this location to others. Thank you both for all your help."
"Supurb Facility!!!
Dr. James Blackwell is very kind, caring, & compassionate individual. I've been dealing with chronic pain for years.  He always take the time to explain things and answer questions.  Dr. Blackwell is professional, very knowledgeable, & attentive to your individual needs ... goes above and beyond to provide the best level of care.  He's understanding of the discomfort that I'm in.
Alexis is always friendly, courteous, and polite.  She always has a positive attitude.  From day one, I've always felt welcomed.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dr. James Blackwell (BenchMark Physical Therapy) without hesitation."
"Dr. Blackwell and his staff are the absolute best and they are soooooooo caring and friendly. This is outright the best Dr ever. He really is taking care of my needs and also pushing me to get back to 100 percent like I was before my accident. He not only cares about my injured leg but other leg as well because of the surgeries I‚Äôve had previously. If you need a therapist for any reason, PLEASE choose Benchmark Leesburg, Ga and you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"An excellent experience! Very knowledgeable in the science and application of techniques and methods to fix problems. Personable, caring and thoughtful. Each visit he took great care to evaluate progress and add techniques that helped my recovery. A real Professional. I would send my mother and my kids to see him."
Very professional and friendly environment that focus 110% on getting you back to normal for regular day to day activities.
"Dr. Blackwell and his staff are very friendly, sweet and passionate people. Dr. Blackwell always takes time out of his busy schedule to make sure he answers all your questions or just to make sure you get that ‚Äúone on one‚Äù feeling even if he has several patients in at one time. Dr. Blackwell is very knowledgeable on how the body should operate and how he can make it operate again at 100%. I walked in on my first visit barely able to walk because of all the pain and when I left I had little to no pain when doing any activity. Since that day I have never had another day where I could barely walk. When I go in for treatment I always get greeted with smiles and a treatment that is always taking the pain away and improving my mobility. I highly recommend Dr. Blackwell or any Benchmark Physical Therapy around the nation."
Remarkable astonishing services. I am extremely satisfied.  James Blackwell and his staff are efficient and caring. I felt improvement with my flexibility  and balance after each session. I recommend Benchmark highly to anyone who want to see faster result with their therapy.
"This was my first experience with a physical therapist and I was somewhat nervous.  Dr. Blackwell quickly put me at ease.  He is interested in his patients themselves as well as their physical condition.  His techniques and exercises have helped me greatly.  Determining I also had a vertigo issue, Dr. Blackwell showed me techniques for dealing with that problem.  Thanks so much to Dr. Blackwell and Alexis. I feel welcome and comfortable every time."
The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. They take the time to know their patients and care about their wellbeing. They teach the patient how to do the exercises the correct way for maximum benefit. Highly recommend!!!
"GREAT PLACE !!! I been going for about three weeks. The stuff is very friendly and helpful, He explains everything that he‚Äôs going to be doing that day and Answers any questions I might have. Has a great location and hours to work around your busy week."
The quality of care I have received from Benchmark Physical Therapy is A+. Im a truck driver and I experienced a near fatal accident last year. Dr.James is a knowledgeable and caring therapist that listens and takes in consideration your thoughts and feelings. He makes you feel like a participant in your rehab. He really cares about you as  a person. He challenges you to think outside the box of what you think physical therapy is and I love it. If you are in need of physical therapy go see Dr. James and his staff at Benchmark in Leesburg Georgia. You won't be disappointed!!! He has me on the road to recovery.
Second vist and dr blackwell and staff take the time to listen spend time making sure your pain level is not hurting more then when u started and getting the help you need they are very genuine and respect and love to help others highly recommend seen other pt's and without a doubt would highly recommend them
"Not only amazing customer service, BenchMark Physical Therapy exceeded my expectations on every level. I would highly recommend to anyone in need of guidance and or rehabilitation."
"Dr Blackwell was great during my rehab for a  ruptured my Achilles.  He had a great balance of walking me thru what to expect, encouraging me on days I needed it and keeping me from pushing too hard on days when  I got bit too aggressive.  I'm very grateful for his skill on getting me back together after such a rough injury."
Very knowledgable and personable. You leave feeling better than when you came in. I highly recommend using Benchmark Physical Therapy!!
Excellent staff. Knowledgeable and patient.




Best physical therapy office in milledgeville. The staff is e and courteous. They helped me regain my mobility and maintain my independence. I'm very thankful for them
"Thanks to Steve, I can enjoy the ease of  mobility once again! This has been life changing. He encourages you to stay focused and stick with the treatment plan. Telisha and the staff are welcoming and supportive. By far, the best TP in town!"
I was in a car accident in December and was referred to benchmark in Milledgeville ga. I went for for only 5 days and because of the wreck I feel they took advantage. 5 days cost me over $4000! They never put me on machines or anything! But I was charged for it. They trumped up a bill! Never use them when your in a car wreck!
"Best physical therapy office in Milledgeville hands down. I can personally attest to this based of my previous experience at another office in this city. He is very knowledgeable about his craft and ensures that everyone understands their injury and the things that can be done to improve them. He constantly upgrades the techniques he uses as your strength progresses, making sure to shock your body to see things from every perspective. The office and its staff is very inviting and welcoming to everyone that comes in. The atmosphere Steve presents is like we all at the back yard barbeque a little hurt, but cracking jokes while we are working on healing ourselves."
The staff is very professional and helpful. The clinic director really puts the patients first and makes their care top priority. Highly recommend!
Dr. Bauernfeind is extremely knowledgeable and is really great with his patients! The atmosphere is always so much fun! I definitely recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy in Milledgeville!
Steve is very patient and understanding of my pain. Trenissia is very sweet when I  come to office.
Steve are very good therapy very nice keep me on my toes
Steve is fantastic! He works so well with me everyday and is always with a smile on his face!
Very knowledgeable and helpful! 10/10 experience

"Dr. Walker and her team are very professional and helpful. I had no doubt that I was in good hands at every visit. Dr. Walker listens to her patients and provides the best exercise program for your needs. She does not overbook herself giving her the ability to really focus on her patients. She also takes the time to clean equipment in between use which shows her level or commitment to her practice and patients. Always welcomed in by Katie who always had a smile on her face and had all the paperwork and necessary documents ready to go.
Highly recommend Benchmark Dublin, GA for all your PT needs!"
"No words can describe the experience I had here at Benchmark, Lora and her team made my entire experience one to remember. I felt like I was at home during each visit and they made me feel comfortable. We talked through the pain and they showed you they care about despite any thing .. this one is the one to go too you want be disappointed"
"Lora Beth Walker is the best physical therapist I have ever had. She worked with me for headaches, TMJ, knotted muscles, and pain going down both arms.  She is very knowledgeable about every condition.  She is kind and caring to every patient.  She worked really hard to get my insurance approved.  She used dry needling for my problems along with stretching and exercise that helped a lot.  Getting an appointment is easy and Katie the secretary is really sweet and works with you. I can‚Äôt thank them enough for helping me and being so good to me."
Dr. Walker is awesome. She really listens to her patients. She makes you want to do your best. Is she a cheerleader for her patients. If she sees that you could benfient from something new she advocates for you to get it. She is the best. Feels more like a friend helping you than a doctor.
Thank you to Lora at the Dublin office. When I wanted to give up on myself she continued to encourage and push me. When I missed a day because I didn't feel good the office called and sincerely checked on me. For all your PT needs I truly recommend Benchmark in Dublin.üôÇ
"Dr. Walker and staff are wonderful! I look forward to going to therapy because there is a family atmosphere. They are very concerned about their patients. If I miss a day, they will call to check on me. I wouldn‚Äôt want to do physical therapy at any other place!!"
"Benchmark is the best physical therapy provider in central Georgia. I would not be able to walk, much less work or play with my kids, without excruciating pain if not for Dr. Walker's help. She also advocated for more treatment when I needed it. All I had to do was show up and get better. I have no doubt my physical abilities and we'll being are exponentially better than if I had not been treated at Benchmark physical therapy. So thank you Dr. Walker!"
Benchmark has done wonders for my back and shoulder pain and muscle spasms! The staff is super friendly and they work great around my work schedule for appointments! Highly recommend them to anyone needing physical therapy!!
Bench Mark helped my mom out when she gets better I hope she can get more physical therapy.
My first appointment here and I am impressed with the knowledgeable staff. They took their time with me and seem to be thorough. I will enjoy coming here for therapy
I‚Äôve just started going to Benchmark and it‚Äôs been a great experience. The staff is super nice and are very experienced and knowledgeable.
"They are very nice and kind and help you out when you need help and they have good respect I‚Äôll refer anybody that‚Äôs need physical therapy the best one in Dublin,GA"
Excellent facility. I will recommend them to everyone who is in need of physical therapy.
The whole experience is awesome. The staff has been very determined to get me back to full swing of things and they are caring and friendly. They actually pay close attention to how you are feeling and the exercises are very effective. Im sore but I feel my strength building and only had 5 visits so far. Great place!! Lora and Brooke make you really feel welcome.
Benchmark is the best therapist group. All so friendly and makes you feel comfortable. For sure they know what they are doing. I was well way before my time was up. My therapy plan worked.
The people are nice and they do a great job at what they do
Great
"My experience at Benchmark on Townelake in Woodstock has been excellent!! The reason is Kristin G. She is knowledgeable, extremely pleasant, and compassionate. Kristin‚Äôs style and motivational support has been instrumental in my progress toward pain relief following my extensive back surgery. I highly recommend her.
Also, the front desk people are very friendly and helpful."
Bench Mark is a great facility to choose in your recovery process from the awesome ladies that check you in to the friendly therapists that really care about getting you pain free. I used Taylor Maida and was very pleased with my progress. He helped me to understand each exercise and its purpose in my healing process. He was there every step of the way encouraging and pushing me just enough to get me where I needed to be. Thank you Taylor. You far exceeded my expectations.
"I had a bimalleolar fracture with dislocation of my right ankle. After the cast came off I started therapy at Benchmark in Woodstock. The whole staff there is incredible. Very friendly and helpful. My therapist was Ms. Brianna, that woman is amazing. Being 53 and having other health problems I thought that I would never walk again. She spent 5 weeks with me, I can now walk with my air boot and am starting to take steps without the air boot. I can never thank her enough."
"Out of all the therapy locations I've been to, the physical therapist, Taylor Maida, was the best therapist I've ever had. He went above and beyond during my sessions. He was very curtious, friendly and so respectful. He trained me and was very knowledgeable with the exercises. I highly recommend Taylor for anyone needing PT."
"Entire staff was friendly and courteous.
My therapist, Kristen Gallagher, was outstanding.  She was always concerned with how I felt, but would push me to improve each day. Thanks to Kristen, 100% of my goals were met or surpassed."
"From my first visit to my last Kristen Gallagher was thorough in assessing my needs and communicating a therapy plan for helping me with my back pain, which after about 2 months of treatment is nearly unnoticeable, whereas before I could hardly sit still without pain. I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome, and it wouldn't have been possible without Kristen and everyone else at Benchmark. Thanks!"
Professional and personal care from the moment you walk-in until you leave. Kristin was very attentive and listened to my symptoms in an unhurried manner. She offered different at home exercises to keep me pain free. I totally recommend Benchmark.
"To hear the words i would never walk properly again after my accident hurt, but when I started PT here, they told they would do everything to get me walking properly. The result so far have been awesome. I am currently walking without crutches and my knee scooter. I still have a limp when I walk but its only getting better. The team here in woodstock are awesome, friendly and encouraging. They want you to succeed and achieve the goal, that you have in place"
Taylor is a great guy to work with and very knowledgeable!
I have been working with Kristen at Benchmark in Woodstock.  I actually had more than one issue to deal with and from the beginning she has been very conscious and aware of the discomfort I was experiencing.  She  adjusted the movements we did accordingly. I had friends who quit going to therapy because They felt as though the therapist was increasing their pain.   She helps to make sure that you make progress but at the level of endurance that you‚Äôre comfortable with.  She is very knowledgeable and has a very soothing personality.  She assisted  me in achieving positive results.  I highly recommend her.   I also would like to mention that it is a very friendly atmosphere.
"I am beyond pleased with my experience at BenchMark!  I received PT there for close to 2 months and the results are fantastic!  I am now moving around with no pain and have greater range of motion in my hip.  I am so thankful to my PT Joe for getting me out of the pain cycle and putting me on the pathway to maintaining a pain free and more mobile lifestyle!  All of the staff at BenchMark were always helpful and friendly.  I know they were smiling behind their masks!  They did a great job with sanitizing and keeping patients socially distanced as well!  Thank you, BenchMark Physical Therapy!!  If I need PT again, I know where I'll go first!"
"Very friendly atmosphere. Courteous front desk staff. Susan, Susannah, Haley, Christian all very friendly.
Matt very knowledgeable and a strong desire to help me recover and gain my strength and movement back in my shoulder."
"I found the team at BenchMark PT in Woodstock, Ga to be excellent care providers.  From the front desk to the therapists, they are all friendly, attentive, cooperative and professional.  I was very impressed with Matt Kilgore from the first time I met him and for the next 8 weeks of therapy on my partial knee replacement.  I am playing golf again and getting around great.
In conclusion...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.they are the best!!!

Nick Cawood"
"I was nervous to start PT because I had never done anything like it before, but I felt so welcomed on my first visit. I worked with Matt, and my recovery was smooth. I actually looked forward to my appointments. I am thankful that I found benchmark."
I just love the staff there they are just a warm welcoming and are very helpful and make you feel very comfortable with your therapy I‚Äôve been coming there for a very long time and I recommend it for everyone that needs therapy and if your insurance will accept it there but I love it there they listen to your needs to help you progress in making you better . Plz come out to them and let them help you get better with your therapy needs thank you happy thanksgiving and happy holidays to you all .
good workout.  the trainers are all professional and knowlegable.
"For the past month, I have been attending PT sessions at BenchMark. To say that my condition has improved is a complete understatement. The staff is so friendly and they really seem to care. In particular, my therapist, Kat, is phenomenal. I always feel like she hears me and tailors each session to whatever we have discussed beforehand. She has made a true difference in a short period of time and I look forward to continuing to heal under her care."
"Rotator cuff surgery 3 months ago, PT in Woodstock.  Matt Kilgore worked with me the whole time.  Pushed me just enough, to discomfort, but never pain, and the recovery was amazing.  Full range of motion after about 5 weeks, and strength coming back daily.  He's a true professional as well as a pleasure to work with.  Hope I never need PT again, but if I do, I'm asking for Matt!"
"Having had 3 surgeries within the past 20 months on my right hip, I have been to 2 locations and have received outstanding service at each one. The PTs are the best with focus on my recuperation and well being.  I won't go anywhere else.  They are a very professional group of people."
Excellent therapist. Never had to wait when I arrived. Highly recommended.
"When I dislocated my shoulder playing tennis, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect from physical therapy.  My doctor gave me a list of several places that I could go, but I chose Benchmark in Woodstock, and I am glad that I did.  The whole experience was positive, from communication and scheduling, to the personal care and professionalism of my physical therapist, Matt, and all the physical therapists there, I always felt welcome.  I can see the results after 6 weeks of training; my shoulder muscles are stronger and I feel better.  I don‚Äôt wish shoulder pain on anyone, but if your doctor recommends physical therapy, I recommend Benchmark Woodstock."
I loved my experiences here. The first day I started with Kat she asked what my goals of recovery were. She has truly lived up to that and I feel she has gotten me to achieve them and I always have a wonderful experience with her. She‚Äôs awesome!
"BenchMark Woodstock is the very best! Went to Dr.Tyler Miller for knee and ankle injuries and he was the absolute best! But you really can‚Äôt go wrong with any of the Woodstock location staff! They are all very attentive, caring, approachable, and driven to get you the results you want (and need!)! I can not recommend them more highly!"
"This facility is wonderful and has surpassed all of my expectations! Not only is my Physical Therapist Tyler amazing, but the entire staff is super friendly and goes above and beyond to provide exceptional customer service. From the start of my very first appointment I felt comfortable, welcome, and excited about my recovery.  I would recommend this facility to everyone who is looking!"
Awesome staff highly recommend this place!!!
Outstanding clinicians! They helped me more with a shoulder injury that had been lingering than other clinics were able to accomplish. Couldnt be more pleased!!!
"The staff is energetic, friendly and caring towards its patients. I have been going for 4 weeks for vestibular therapy and it has been a wonderful experience all around. I greatly recommend this facility to anyone in need of rehabilitation therapy."
"Benchmark Physical Therapy on Towne Lake Pkwy, did a great job helping me strengthen my ankle. It had been sprained and never healed correctly for 2 years. In 6 weeks, it is much stronger and I have a doable, home exercise plan to get it even better. All the staff are knowledgeable, friendly  and caring. I especially enjoyed my therapist, Lena. She became a friend, and I'll miss seeing her."
"A huge thanks to Nicole and her great team at BenchMark in Woodstock, GA.  From my 1st day through the last, the BenchMark team supported my ""stubbornness"" to regain full use of my knee.  After just 6 short weeks, I was able to do so and move forward again with my physical activity.  The BenchMark team was always cheerful and they made going to PT very enjoyable.  It's amazing how well they work together.  Thanks to Nicola and her awesome team!!"
"This is my second time going to a pt clinic. I like this one so much more! The staff is amazing and I feel like they really care about helping me get better and trying to get me to my goals! I feel much better now and  have actually learned techniques that work and can be used at home.

Always double check your Insurance coverage though. Mine gave the clinic the wrong information the first time and I had to call the insurance to fix it."
"I've received friendly, professional service from my first call to the office through more than 10 visits now.  The therapists and assistants have provided consistently attentive treatment that has strengthened and rehabilitated my knee.  Feels like home when I have a visit, and my full recovery is in view. Special thanks to Tyler, Emily, Zach, and Logan!"
"As soon as you become a part of this therapy team you will never want to leave. They care about you, and you can't beat their  amazing staff. Alex is wondering, and he's very dedicated to getting you the treatment you deserve. This is a wonderful experience I will not forget. Thanks to Alex and benchmark staff for your amazing service."
"Excellent!! Joseph did a remarkable job on my neck, back and shoulders after my car accident! Highly recommend this place!"
Love my PT at Benchmark! Heather is awesome. She is always asking how I feel and making sure she is addressing any issues I am having. I look forward to our visits knowing every time I go the better I'm going to get. Thanks Heather!!
"This place has a friendly staff.   It's very clean and the Physical Therapist are knowledgeable.
I met with Dr Lonergan and he was thorough.  He explained what was causing my issues and gave helpful tips on how to prevent it in the future.

I hope you don't need a physical therapist but if you do, you won't go wrong chosing this group."
I was vert impressed with BenchMark Physical Therapy.  Outstanding care and knowledge
"I have gone to this location for several weeks with no change in my pain level. On at least two occasions, prior to today,!the therapist who was suppose to be working with me, was also working with another client and I felt like I got very little attention from the therapist.  I spent most of the time with the therapist telling assistants to have me do one stretching exercise after another with very little attention from the therapist. Today while I was there, the therapist had an assistant have me do  stretches the entire time, while she worked hands on with another client right beside me. I finally left 10 minutes before the end of my session because it was obvious I was getting no personal attention today and I could do the exercises myself at home.  I will not be returning to this location."
"If there had been six stars, I'd have used them!

I've been to several physical therapists  in this area, and Benchmark exceeds them all on every front.   The setting is large, clean and very pleasant to be in.   The staff is friendly and professional.  Smiling Emily greets you, and trainers Zach, Terrence and Courtney are fun, but diligent.

My therapist, Tim Lonergan, was my own shining star.  He helped me through a knee replacement and an extremely painful Achilles tendon problem.  After my knee surgery, I knew I had a limited window to get my range-of-motion back.  I had spent two weeks with another therapy group, and felt that I wasn't getting the level of help I needed -- and the window was closing.   Tim was heartily recommended to me by my sister, so I switched to him.  I am very fortunate to have found him.   From the first session (which actually was with another therapist, Stephanie), I knew I was in the right place.

To say Tim puts himself into his task is an understatement.   He thoughtfully listens to you talk and describe your pain.  Even though the trainers lead you through some exercises, Tim's eye is always on you to call the plays and make corrections if needed.  I've never had a session that Tim did not personally attend me.   He is obviously very knowledgeable and experienced in what he does.   He works hard to apply all that knowledge and experience to his patients. He is professional, caring, articulate, personable and  seemingly a genius at his chosen line of work and respected by all: his staff, attending students and every patient I ever chatted with.   Oh, and if soccer ever comes up, quick, act like you're a fan.

Do yourself a favor and get the most thorough and caring help possible with Tim and Benchmark."
Great facility. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. They have helped my recovery greatly.
"Scott is great, the staff are wonderful and I will definatly use this location CD or all my PT needs

Dawn Poteat"
"Great place, very positive staff.  Special thanks to Matt!"
"Matt Ayers is very professional, considerate and is doing a great job getting me on the road to recovery. Ask him about his archery skills if you ever get a chance üëåüèΩ"

"I had Osteoarthritis surgery on my right hand in November 2019. I'm happy to say I've come a long way with the help of my therapists Billy and Morgan working with me. The front office personnel always greets everyone with a smile. Joyce is professional and answers any question I may have.

I highly recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy. You are in good hands.

Sincerely,
Robert ""Bob"" Vane"
"I highly recommend the Benchmark Physical Therapy center in LaGrange.  It is well run with wonderful staff and will give you the most excellent results in your path to wellness.
My doctor sent me to the clinic because I had become de-conditioned due to contracting both Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.  I was placed on a program to build up my weak muscles,  and was given hands-on dry needling and muscle manipulation for connective tissue problems.   I also was experiencing vertigo and balance issues.  Ben, my therapist, quickly found the source to be muscular, not inner-ear, and was able to restore my balance, giving me stability and confidence to walk without fear of falling.
Benchmark in LaGrange has helped me tremendously to restore my joints and muscles to be strong and function smoothly as they should."
"Excellent therapists, friendly staff"




"They are the best and have the Best attitude in helping you get better! They are so kind and truly are there for your Best interest. I love the different options they have to help you to confirm all your appointments. You will not find a better team like Kendra, Hanna and Robin they are GREAT!!!"
"I will always go to Benchmark for Physical Therapy !! They are wonderful people !!! They are always respectful and your privacy and well being during threapy is ALWAYS a priority !!!  Kendra (Abercorn Location) is a joy to be around and she makes your therapy fun and stress free !!! Robin the Receptionist (Abercorn Location) is always cheerful, polite and makes you smile the minute you walk in the door !!! #BenchmarkPhysicalTherapyIsAwesome #KeepUpTheGreatWork
Sincerely A Loyal Client"
"The staff is courteous, friendly and very caring.  Exceptional in the concerns for your wellbeing.  Very clean and organized.  One-on-one attention and very focus on your improvement and what works.

Strongly recommend this location for their services."
"This  is a wonderful  place to start healing from tour injury/surgeries  .
From the minute you walk into the facility you are greeted with a smile.
I have been comming here for several weeks now, and everyone is treated like family!
I'm healing from an ankle injury,
And will soon need knee surgery, will be using this facility again.
Thanks to everyone  here
Phyllis"
Today was my last day with BenchMark. Gonna miss the staff.Kendra Wilholt you are great. You and Hannah have been wonderful. You were understanding and so very helpful. You encourage me when I needed it most. You didn't push me when I was hurting and your massages sure helped when I was having such alful head achs. I will stop in time to time to say hello. Thank you ladies for all you do.
"Great welcoming environment, great staff. Awesome place to heal!"

Jessica and the entire staff are awesome. I went in not being able to climb a step with my right foot.  Thanks to Jessica (& God of course) I have strength to walk again.  Thanks for giving my life back to me. Bless you all!
This practice is super clean! Jonathan and the staff are truly professional and I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to send any of my loved ones here for any type of therapy necessary. HIGHLY Recommend... 5 stars aren‚Äôt enough
Over the last 12 years our family has needed physical therapy on multiple occasions. Sad to say the results were very spotty at best. Two years ago I needed a knee replacement with Dr. DeCook and he referred me to Jonathon's office for the pt. I had never heard of them  before so I was a little reluctant to use them. Jonathon was very welcoming and assigned me to Josh Stroud for my therapy. I was finished in 3 weeks and was  able to regain complete use of my leg and knee and was pain free for the first time  in years. I can't say enough  good things about these  folks. They are simply the best we have ever worked with!
"My experience at Benchmark brings a smile to my faceüòä Walking into their business the first time after having just gotten rid of my ortho boot was exciting. Not so much that the boot was gone but I was getting ready to get full mobility back! Yeah! I was ready to get my life back! And I did! My therapist Jonathan was my friend, my support, my source of information. I am so thankful to him and the whole team of people working there. Observing other ‚Äúpatients‚Äù working with their therapist I realized there are a lot of people needing help. When we need help what a BLESSING to have the help given in a kind, gentle, caring way. Thank you for being there for all of us needing your help."
After a recent surgery on  a crushed wrist I was referred to  Jennifer at Benchmark in Dahlonega. She is so easy to work with and talk to. She is knowledgeable and a very effective occupational therapist. I also enjoyed getting to know the other therapist there. All who work there are kind and caring! I suggest Benchmark Therapy when looking for care in the Lumpkin county area!
Top notch professionals here. They know what they're doing and genuinely care about you. My experience could not have been better!
"Had to get Pt for my leg and OT for my arm after a planned and unplanned surgery.
Jennifer and Jonathon are fantastic and go the extra mile to make sure you are progressing and to work with you even when you‚Äôre feeling like progress isn‚Äôt being made. The hospitality and warmness of the staff is always nice, you almost feel at home with this group.
If you‚Äôre looking for a place in north Georgia for physical therapy, make it benchmark!"
"Love the care and treatment I've received at Benchmark.  Jennifer Hoyt is the OT that I see on a weekly basis and has the patience of a saint.  When I could not use my hand after surgery, she patiently worked with me to obtain some functions.  After several weeks I had movement however it was not optimal.  Jennifer fabricated a device that I wear several hours a day which resulted in greater mobility.  She is a consummate professional, dedicated to healing her patients.  I highly recommend Dahlonega Benchmark."
"I highly recommend Benchmark Therapy in Dahlonega.  Furthermore, having the opportunity to work with Jessica during my rehabilitation has been a blessing. She is patient, knowledgeable and allows for my input on progress after exercises.  She answers questions and gives solid advice. Lastly, I would like to highlight the front desk - Sharon and Maddie - and other therapists Jonathan, Seth and Josh.  They are ways willing to help and provide outstanding customer service. Bottomline the entire facility goes beyond to make for a positive experience.  I am very pleased with my progress thus far."
"I started at Benchmark in July 2019 after injuring my back at the gym, I couldn‚Äôt stand up straight, walk, sit, or sleep comfortably. After 5 months of help from Josh, not only was I fully recovered from that injury, but we addressed several other issues I was having, and on my last session I hit a new personal record for squatting and deadlifting. Josh has helped me recover and progress far beyond what I thought I was capable of, and helped restore confidence in my strength and abilities. No matter what kind of mood I walked through the door in, I always left with a smile on my face. The whole staff is friendly, caring, and helpful."
"Amazing experience! I never felt ""heard"" before coming here regarding my pain, and they really understand you and listen to you here.  I needed late appointments due to my work schedule, and I never once felt like it was an inconvenience or rushed.  Scott, Jessica, and Jonathan are all very helpful and kind.. really the whole staff is so nice, down to Sharon at the front desk!  I will be telling everyone about my positive experience and referring anyone who needs PT to this office!!"
"Great staff, super clean facility, easy access.  Worked to build up strength before total knee replacement. Therapists are determined to get patients stronger with program of exercises, needling, cupping and at home workouts.
Work with insurance plans, doctor request and your ability. Follow up maintenance program is cost effective and convenient."
"Super friendly environment & experienced therapists. With time, I was able to get back to the same level of function I was at before surgery. Overall, I would definitely recommend Benchmark to those needing therapy."
Jenn is the best OT that I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Great fun loving place to get treated. Genuinely cares about patients and their happiness and health.
From my grandmother Judy Boulineau: I have to rate them at 100% A++. I appreciated their kindness and patience with me and them helping my knee. Therapy isn‚Äôt easy but they made it enjoyable. All of them was so kind and sweet.
"Some of the best physical therapists you will ever meet! Clean facility, friendly staff, and great care. Highly recommend!"
"Seth and Jessica were so friendly and helpful! Thanks for everyone who helped with my recovery, great place!"
I would recommend Benchmark to anyone i know. Very friendly and very professional.


"The staff at Benchmark Tyrone are very professional and caring treating each patient with a personal touch. I was very impressed by the Therapist when they addressed each patient by their name, each time I came in for my workout they called me and others by our names and I felt special because I felt they new me and attended to my specific need as well as the other patients. I would recommend this facility in Tyrone to anyone that was in need of physical therapy one 100%."


"I am greatly impressed on the care, professionalism and patience of this staff.  I was highly doubtful that I was going to get results due to past experiences at other physical therapy offices.   I went from being barely able to step up or down a curb to feeling like I have a realistic possibility of running again.  Dionne took very good care of me and I was very lucky to have her assigned to me.  I would recommend her to anyone.  Inhad a neck and back surgery and I always felt like she was going to get me as close to normal as possible.  Thank you so much!!!!"
Lynnette Booth is the best physical therapist that I have ever had. She is very knowledgeable and professional. When you asked her a question she explains why and just don‚Äôt leave you hanging for an answer. She knows exactly what techniques that works best for your situation. I will give her a five star ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è any day because she is so pleasant to have as your physical therapist!
"When I first came to Benchmark I was in a boot unable to put pressure on my left ankle. Alan and Anthony did a excellent job of helping me regain functionality of my foot. By my last session, I was able to walk comfortably out of the facility without any aid."
"They refused to correct my insurance deductible, felt like I was joining a gym (signing a membership contract) ... had to promise to pay full family deductible  ... I pay from my EOBs period!!! I don't pay until they've processed the paperwork correctly and the insurance company tells me how much I owe!!! It's hard enough reconciling their stmts to the EOBs, I'm not going to compound it with overpaid partial payments. Been there before and never got a refund!!! The deductible is not a static figure, and I'm sure not going to pay my husband's portion when it's just me!!! Insurance says one thing to me and something different to them, no I dont think so!!!!"
"What a great facility and staff.  Everyone here is first class.  Thanks Laurin, Joe and Bradley for pushing the envelop to try harder for the best possible results.  Was a lot of work but they made it as much fun as possible. Eight weeks after surgery for a new knee I am pretty much back to doing everything I want.  Cannot say enough for PT Solutions!!"
"I came to P T Solutions Woodstock east after having shoulder and biceps surgery.  Many people would see me with my sling and approach me saying ‚Äú shoulder right?  It will never be the same‚Äù.  I was bummed at how many strangers told me this out of the blue.  BUT I can tell you that having this surgery at age 61, I now have full range of motion and nothing hurts.  Now it took time but 8 months after surgery I am good as before.  I owe it all to the PT‚Äôs at PT solutions.  I worked with 3 of the staff there and all were wonderful and good at what they do.  I want to stress that Woodstock East is where I went and I recommend anyone there. Thank you guys greatly for getting g me back to normal!  I did all you told me and we were totally successful!"
"Just an amazing group of people. Very patient and friendly

I highly recommend this PT solutions"
Very helpful and understanding. The staff and front office are the best . You fill very welcome . I would recommend them to anyone

"I highly recommend this place. McKenzie is the most kindest soul. She's very respectful, courteous and so friendly. She knows you by name when you walk in the door. I love how I feel when I walk in and when I walk out. Jessica greets you with a smile as soon as you walk in. She's very sweet and respectful. The whole atmosphere is awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. I'm going to miss it when my time is up üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä. Highly recommend this place for your physical therapy. God bless each of you"
"I have completed weeks of therapy with Ms. McKenzie.  I feel so much better.  She is so kind, knowledgeable, and genuine.  She loves her job and and it shows.  I look forward to going therapy at Benchmark.  She has been so helpful  improving my pain. I strongly suggest that you go to her, when you need a physical therapist.  You will not be disappointed! I  just love her and her staff!"
"I have completed 6 weeks of therapy with Ms. McKenzie.  I feel better.  She is friendly, encouraging, knowledgeable, and genuine.  She loves her job and she does it well.  I look forward to my therapy.  She has many helpful methods of improving my pain. I strongly suggest that one go to her, when you need a physical therapist.  You will not be disappointed!"
Jessica and McKenzie are both wonderful women. They're super nice and McKenzie works well with her patients never pushing farther than they're comfortable with. I am loving my experience as a patient at Benchmark Physical Therapy.
Fantastic on time service. Friendly staff. Responsive office. First physical therapy routine that actually worked to alleviate my son‚Äôs flat fee pain.
"I‚Äôve had lots of physical therapy over my 68 years - hips ,ankle, shoulder, neck. This is the best clinic of all the clinics I have used. They are compassionate, professional, innovative and efficient. They really care about you."
"I'm extremely grateful I chose Benchmark to help me with my recovery. My physical therapist, Karen was professional, kind, knowledgable, and encouraging throughout my experience with Benchmark. My healing and confidence have come a long way since the 12 weeks ago I started my physical therapy and I'm extremely grateful and satisfied with my progress.Their offices felt safe and sanitized and the staff is visibly making every effort to keep their patients healthy with regards to the ongoing pandemic. Highly recommend this Benchmark location!"
"This was one of my best, and favorite, PT experiences. Emma and her team are experts who enjoy what they do. The best part is the results. I truly haven't felt better in a decade. They get my highest recommendation."
Karen provided excellent physical therapy services and explained reasons for each exercise. She cares for her patients and provides good guidence on how to get the most out of the therapy for improving motion and reducing pain. I highly recommend Karen for her professionalism and great personality.
"I started going to Benchmark after recent knee surgery. This was my first experience with  physical therapy. From the first visit until my last one yesterday, these professionals were absolutely the most caring, knowledgeable and inspiring group. I was encouraged every step of the way. I have witnessed their hands on and diligent approach with many other patients as well as I was at my appointments.  This staff is a real team effort. Would highly recommend this Benchmark‚Äô location . A.Grant"
"I had some minor shoulder pain and went to benchmarkon holcomb bridge road for physical therapy. Danielle was my PT therapist. She was fantastic. I went for a couple of months and my shoulder improved immensely. The staff was great, very professional. i highly recommend them."
"I had been to a physical therapist recommended by my podiatrist for plantar fasciitis. After that therapist made more body parts inflamed and painful, I found Emma Stewart at Benchmark on Holcomb Bridge. After my initial visit with her and receiving dry needling as well as therapy exercises, I noticed improvement immediately. Over the course of 12 visits, my plantar fasciitis improved 95%. Her dry needling skills are superior. Her therapy exercises are spot on. The clinic is very welcoming and positive. I have already referred a friend to Emma. Emma is the absolute best!"
"Excellent physical therapy team, highly skilled with genuine care for patients."
everything was done well from beginning to end! everyone thinks physical therapy is hard. benchmark and espescially Karen made it a joy! she was fun to work with and rapidly reduced my neck and shoulder pain both with her expertise of excersises in addition to her skills massaging out the knots. i would not hesitate to return to benchmark for any pt needs in the future! I'm back to my old self again. Pain free. thanks sooo much!
"After MANY visits for leg and shoulder therapy during the last 12 months, I couldn't be more pleased. I was pushed just enough for continued improvement.
And their response to the current unpleasantness"" is really as good as you could ask for, with continual wiping of all surfaces and equipment immediately after use."
"I highly recommend this Benchmark location. I personally worked with Emma, but the entire staff at this location is fantastic, personable, and accommodating. She ensured my exercises were printed (with pictures for me) each week, including my last day of PT so I could continue to improve at home. She pushed me and I feel 100% stronger than when I started and feel a lot more confident in the home exercises for continued positive improvement. Thank you all for the great care!"
"The staff couldn't be better at what they do. They're knowledgeable, professional and amicable. My progress has been excelent after my surgery."
"I was diagnosed with PTTD (Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction) by my orthopedic doctor.  It was recommended I seek physical therapy to help.  I found BenchMark and made my first appointment at the Holcomb Bridge location.  My first day I was introduced to Emma Stewart.  She greeted me with kindness and showed that I wasn't just another patient for her.  Seeing her with other patients, I noticed right away how attentive she was and concerned for their care.  I went twice a week for 6 weeks only seeing Emma each day.  My over all experience was wonderful!  No only did my ankle feel so much better, but my muscles were getting stronger.  The first day, I tried to balance on one foot for 30 secs.  That was harder than I thought.  On the last day, it was SO much easier.  I could definitely feel a difference!  Everyone there was always so nice and caring.  It's like a family there!  I would recommend going to this location for all your physical therapy needs!  They are all great at what they do and are caring during the process."
"I had knee surgery back in October and was recommended to go to Benchmark for physical therapy. Fast forward to now and I am happy to say that I feel great thanks to the team at Benchmark!

Danielle was my physical therapist throughout my time rehabbing. She is very kind and very knowledgable at what she does. She was extremely helpful with getting me back on my feet. Her patience and expertise made my time there enjoyable and made me look forward to rehabbing my knee.

I know rehab can be boring and tedious, but it is necessary and I couldn't be happier with the service that I got from Benchmark! If you are looking for a great place and a great staff to work with, I highly recommend this place!

Thank you to the Benchmark team for all that you did!"
"Excellent service Mishal, Emma and Corey the therapists are very kind, nice and very patient with patients. The place is perfectly located and easy parking in rear. Plenty satisfied"
"Outstanding operation.  Taylor, Liz, and the entire team are the epitome of professionalism.  Taylor conducts a comprehensive assessment when you start, and then develops a plan that is unique to the challenges and goals of the patient.  My recovery from a complete hip replacement is the fastest and most comprehensive of all of the numerous injury recovery programs I have been involved in over the past 50 years.  It is obvious they truly care about their patients, and are always happy to answer any questions.  As I finished my ""in house"" therapy, Taylor provided an excellent program for me to follow as I get back to where I can begin normal workouts again.  Their care, expertise, and willingness to go the extra mile enabled me to make maximum progress as quickly as possible.  None better."
Amazing place to go! I was treated fairly and amazing! Very nice people and easy to get along with! I had dislocated my knee and I was out within two months able to walk normally and functional again! Highly recommend this facility! Tell them Gary sent you! You won't regret choosing this place!
"The staff here are very friendly and welcoming. While the work they do is serious and at times painful,  their lighthearted humor makes the therapy bearable. I've only been utilizing this facility for a little more than a month but already I've seen improvements in the affected area from my surgery. Taylor is awesome! Totally recommended"
"I‚Äôve been to two other physical therapy groups, and BenchMark Physical Therapy (Holcomb Bridge Road, Alpharetta) is superior!  Taylor strikes a unique balance of expertise, professionalism, and empathetic care, and is able to explain in detail how certain treatment methods work to aid your progress.  As a team, Taylor, Liz, and Tiffany are warm, courteous, organized, and always mindful of all patients in the room (which is spotless).  Can‚Äôt recommend Taylor and his staff enough ‚Äì Thank You!"
"Fantastic people and atmosphere. The staff at the Holcomb Bridge location are engaging, enthusiastic, and demonstrate the highest level of professionalism and competence.
Pro Tip: show them your toe socks to unlock the highest tier of excellence."
"I have been working with this location since May 2016 for a knee injury and subsequent rehab from surgery in November.  Taylor, Liz and his staff have been nothing but amazing to work with.  Taylor is very professional, upbeat and knowledgable about the specific techniques most effective to get my knee back in working order.  No waste of time or money here!  He has the latest equipment at his disposal and utilizes both exercises and manual manipulation of my joint and surrounding tissues to improve my recovery.  He always knows how to cheer me up on a tough pain day too.  Liz his office manager is on top of insurance questions and appointment scheduling and helps me keep track (i have memory issues)!  She always has a cheerful greeting when i walk in the door.  I have never had a bad experience here and highly recommend them to anyone (and send my family and friends here every time!)!  My knee is 100% better because of Taylor - probably in better working order than before I injured it!  Thank you!"
"Kristie Johnson- Alpharetta....Iv'e had amazing results in just 3 visits. I'm stronger, better balance, and less pain walking. I had a hip replacement 8 weeks ago and started P.T. kind of late but I'm headed in the right direction now with Taylor. I like the one big open room concept so he's got his eye on me to make sure I'm doing the exercises correctly.  He's great at educating you about how our muscles work to make sense of these exercises all white getting a hands on massage. I have been to 2 other PT places and I really like this Benchmark on Holcomb Br. Rd."
"First experience going to physical therapy, Taylor and Alex helped me understand my injury and provided excellent guidance and personalized care. Friendly staff and a great office to receive treatment."
"As a healthcare professional and educator, it is with pride and pleasure to have been provided the prescribed physical therapy services by Taylor and his team for the last two weeks. My encounter with the staff was admirably excellent both on professional and personal level.
The staff are friendly, polite, respectful, and disciplined. The facility is meticulously clean and orderly. Their personal relationship among themselves and teamwork is exemplary.
Atnafu Tariku, Ed.D."
Great staff and knowledgeable PT. Taylor has helped me immensely over the last few weeks.




Wonderful experience. Taryn Anthony is wonderful. Excellent therapist and with lots of empathy towards her patients.
Everyone at Benchmark were very knowledgeable.  I felt like they really cared how I was feeling and improving.  I will be happy to use them again if needed.  The help and instructions I was given has become part of my weekly routine!  Thank you Benchmark you were great.
"I've had PT several times at Benchmark and every time I have been extremely pleased with the physical therapists and the service I received. The therapists are compassionate,  professional,  and very knowledgeable.  At my most recent PT at Sugarloaf Duluth Taryn was my therapist. I just love her. And Pam, the clinic director,  is awesome. I highly recommend this facility."
This place is awesome!  I had a proximal humerous fracture in March 2018 and was referred to Pam Frey by several friends that were previously under her care for physical therapy.  Pam and Gene are wonderful to work with and use the appropriate amount of therapy to ensure the quickest rate of healing and mobility.  My arm was immobilized for nine (9) weeks and as a result my ability to move my arm was almost non-existent when the doctor took me out of the sling.  Pam has to stretch my arm and shoulder and again she knows how far to push and pull without causing too much pain and my mobility and strength are almost completely restored.  If you are within 45 minutes this is the place to go for physical therapy.
"My Physical Therapist at PT Solutions, Dr. Michael Gray, is knowledgeable and works in a professional manner. Even during a busy day, he is attentive to the interactions between his interns and patients. I always felt that I'm getting the best possible care and the progress in my treatment shows. I know it's his job, but it's Dr. Gray's way of caring that makes the difference. The whole staff is very courteous; they are, without a doubt, the best.¬† I highly recommend them to everyone I know."
"First time having to do PT and I can honestly say therapy works!
Michael and his team are great. I would recommend to anyone. I had the privilege to work with him and his student Virginia. Michael is kind, patient and extremely knowledgeable and Virginia is sweet and a quick learner she is going to be a great therapist one day.
Thank you both for giving me back the confidence in my knee! #trustyourknee.

You guys are the best!!! I will be forever thankful!"
Everyone at PT Solutions at Windy Hill Hospital is wonderful. Victoria is the one who originally set me up for my first appointment and she was a delight. Michael is the PT there and is nothing but kind and understanding. They have a college student learning with them right now named Virginia - she has given me incredible pointers that I may not have noticed otherwise. I am impressed by this group and would recommend them to anyone. The facility is also very clean. Huge fan!!
"A year ago, I needed physical therapy because I was rear ended on I75, and I happened to choose this practice.  I finished physical therapy a long time ago, but I am still sincerely grateful for the care I received here. Dr. Michael Gray is a very skilled practitioner and genuinely cares for the well-being of his patients. I would highly recommend this office to anyone in need of physical therapy. Thank you Michael and PT Solutions team!!!"
"PT Solutions is great!! Michael, Victoria and Virginia are knowledgeable, very professional and respectful!! I was apprehensive before starting therapy there and now I wouldn‚Äôt know what I would do if without them!! They are all fantastic!!!"
My  experience at PT Solution at Windy Hill is wonderful Emily and Micheal are wonderful Therapist. I thought it would be overwhelming for me but they make me relaxed and comfortable as i work to achieve my goals. they talk you through all the techniques. When my session s over i feel i have reached  my next level without the overwhelming feeling. i would recommend anyone to come to the Windy Hill Location I am glad i made the right choice in choosing there
The staff of PT Solutions at Windy Hill Hospital is awesome! Great listeners and practitioners and I‚Äôm happy to say that my hip pain is no more! My last visit exercises to do at home were reviewed so that I can maintain this pain free status. Highly recommend!
We chose the Windy Hill location because of my mom needing water therapy and they have a large pool to accommodate that. I then started PT with Michael Gray and they are exceptional and so with the drive. Both my mom and I would highly recommend this location for physical therapy needs.
Michael is excellent PT.
"I have been at PT solutions for the past 6 months for my knee, and it has been wonderful! Micheal is an exceptional physical therapist. Great at listening and incorporating how you and your body respond to the physical therapy. The staff are friendly, helpful and great at being flexible with scheduling. You can feel the genuine care for you as patient. Could not have had a better physical therapy experience."
To be treated with respect and gentleness has made my visits enjoyable despite my physical challenges. Taking the time to explain things thoroughly was a real plus for me. The peace and clean atmosphere was the cherry on top!
"I‚Äôve been seeing Dr. Michael Gray for about a month now, and I‚Äôve already improved immensely thanks to him. Michael cares a lot about his patients and their success. He is very motivating and can adapt your recovery method to fit well into your daily life. Overall I am quite pleased with my experience here, so I will definitely be returning for all of my physical therapy needs!"
"After my son suffered a concussion, I was advised to got to PT Solutions. The staff was incredibly kind and helpful with booking spots around a crazy family schedule. Michael (physical therapist) was great with my son.  Michael explained the process to me and got my son back to what his baseline was before the concussion. So grateful for this facility."
".This is such a welcoming Physical Therapy building. Michael and Amy are excellent and make me feel a lot more welcome. Michael is amazing, along with Amy. Since I came right after my surgery, Michael and Amy have helped me progress in these two months. This is by far the best physical therapy place in Atlanta and I 100% reccomend it to everyone. Especially if you happen to be worried or something, this place is absolutely the place to go."
"This was my first time going to a Physical Therapist. And because of my great experience with Michael at PT Solutions it will not be my last. I will continue to go there for my therapy. I also highly recommend PT
Solutions for anyone looking for a great Physical Therapist. Joe Ann"
"PT here with Michael has been life changing. I highly recommend this location to anyone. The progress I have made in a short amount of time has been incredible. The staff are all knowledgeable and friendly, and take time to personally work with you."
"I highly recommend PT Solutions to anyone in need of physical therapy. The staff is smart, kind and in just a few weeks, I've felt better than I have in years for a low back injury that was particularly puzzling. It's great personal attention and they remember your progress week to week, beyond just looking at a chart."
Went here for my knee workers very nice and excellent to kids



"This rehab facility is warm and welcoming from the staff that greets you when you enter to the therapists that help you recover. The therapists take time to evaluate you based on your doctor‚Äôs script for care, then they explain everything that they are going to be doing to assist you in your recovery.
For me the most important thing is they are caring, and they interact with you as an individual one on one. Which in these times of isolation is so very important for those who may isolating due the current state of things socially.
I would highly recommend this facility and its staff."
"Such a great team of therapists.  I think I've worked with almost everyone there, and they all are delightful.  They really listen to you and suggest a wide variety of exercises to fix your problem.  They truly are concerned and care about their patients!"
Ancilla is a wonderful physical therapist! I came in with a lot of pain and she significantly improved my quality of life. She is super caring and will listen to your problems and really help solve them. Amita is also a great occupational therapist!
"The staff at Emory Rehab are courteous, knowledgeable and professional. Ms. Amita explained the benefits and goals of my therapy in way that was very comforting."
Very nice staff. Listen to your complaint and will work to help you with your problem.
I would like to thank Lori Bowler PT and the staff at Peachtree City for being so caring on my first day their  about ten minutes into my appointment while talking to my PT Lori Bowler I became ill to the point emergency services had to be call their quick response and the level of concern they showed for me was amazing ü§© WOW üò≥ BEST STAFF EVER THANKS SO MUCH üëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Coming for Physical Therapy has been a strengthening experience with good progress received. The staff are always so welcoming, professional, patient and kind. I feel confidence in Lori's expertise in helping me."
Excellent excellent service and assistance. Ancilla is an exceptional therapist.
"Amita is amazing!  I went in not sleeping due to pain and barely able to lift my arm due to a bike fall/ shoulder injury. With twice a week guided stretches at the clinic, my twice a day at home stretches and sleeping with a rolled towel to support my shoulder from rolling at night, I have pain free movement for simple tasks and am now working on full range of motion. I can even put my hand in my coat pocket now!  Just a bit more and I should be able to kayak in the spring.  Couldn't be happier,  Amita is amazing!"
Lori was very helpful.  I had a wonderful experience.  She is very good.
Very friendly staff.  Therapist is very knowledgeable and very caring with her patients
"Lori is an excellent Physical Therapist.  Professional, efficient and in tune to her clients' needs.  I would recommend her services to my closest Friends and Family."
"Working with Robin as my Physical Therapist has been a rewarding experience. She initially sat down with me, listening carefully as I explained my back pain issues. Robin selected specific exercises to help strengthen my core which has already paid dividends for me. Robin has a wonderful personality, and I always look forward to our next session. I highly recommend her as a Physical Therapist."
"I didn't know what pelvic floor therapy involved. Apparently it is not something every rehab facility offers, but Emory Rehab in Peachtree City does! It is a bit personal, but Lori made me feel comfortable with the treatment. She was professional and knowledgeable. I can honestly say that the exercises she has prescribed is making a difference."
"The employees are very personal and helpful. Ancilla was my therapist during the rehab of my right knee.
She is great !!"
Great place and wonderful team there!
"Great, Knowledgeable, Professional people. They care about you and your quality of life. They think outside the box while using years of combined knowledge. They get to know you as a group and can meet your physical therapy needs as a individual. Awesome place to recover at. Thanks Team"
"Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center is a just such a healing, strengthening environment. My wife and I have used their facility and assistance three times. There is no other place that i would go for therapy.
The professionals there are excellent, knowledgeable and caring.
I am presently under the care of Ancilla Walker- so very knowledgeable, sincere and her ‚Äútone‚Äù of voice, is calming, relaxing, which I believe adds to the healing.
I would recommend Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center here in Peachtree City above all others.
- Quin Bryan"
"Lorie is great.  Listens to you, asks probing questions, makes accurate diagnosis based on your symptoms.   I would recommend her to everyone."
"I am so pleased with the care and attention to my rehabilitation needs and pain provided by Lori Bowler, physical therapist, at the Emory Rehab Center in Peachtree City.  She works diligently and professionally with me to help me regain strength, mobility and range of motion.  Thanks to Lori and the team at the Peachtree City location.  Wanda Dukes"
Everyone I have interacted with here has been pleasant and professional.  They take a personal interest in patient care and have always been very encouraging about progress.   I would recommend them to anyone in need of rehabilitation services.
First experience has been exceptional. I'm already feeling better and received an accurate diagnosis.
I was treated here for a back injury earlier this year and chose to return for my Total Knee Replacement rehab/physical theropy.  I could not be more satisfied with the personal attention and motivation to get through an extremely taxing recovery. Ancilla is caring yet challenging. I also recently recommend this facility to my mom for her physical theropy needs.
"The very professional and very committed therapists, always treating you with respect and patience a very good attitude trying to make you feel better every day."
"Im not usually one for PT as I've had bad experiences in the past, but these ladies at this clinic are the BEST. They are very friendly and work with you on a more personal level to ensure you they the best possible care while they are treating you.
I highly recommend this clinic.
My Therapist ward Ancilla. She's awesome.
Lois
from Georgia"
Ancilla is amazing!!! I don‚Äôt know why I suffered for over a month before coming back in.... two visits and I had no shoulder/arm pain nor a numb finger!!!
"Professional, knowledgeable staff - addressed all my PT needs with kindness and concern - will be returning after my shoulder surgery"
They are a group of genuinely caring professionals who do their utmost to ensure that you get back to normal.
Ancilla was my therapist. She explained everything very clearly and was extremely pleasant to work with.
Everyone there seems to really care how you‚Äôre feeling and want to help. Very professional and knowledgeable about how to make you better!
"The therapists at Emory/Select Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic get a AAA+++ rating from me! They just refuse to give up on you until you're better by, first, identifying the main source of your problem, and then finding a treatment plan that fits your individual needs and abilities....unlike any other physical therapy/rehabilitation clinic I've ever visited."
"Professional, knowledgeable, caring.."





















The level of care and knowledge that each therapist brings to this location is amazing! They always make you feel welcome and I know that I am in good hands. I have had two shoulder surgeries and my recovery was made so much better knowing they were helping me reach my goals. They truly care about their patients and I wouldn‚Äôt want to go anywhere else for treatment.
"I chose Benchmark for my physical therapy after my grade 2 hip adductor strain. I couldn't be happier that I did!

The staff was knowledgeable, professional and encouraging. They were genuinely interested in my well-being and recovery so that I could return to doing martial arts. Not only was the quality of care superb, but the atmosphere was very welcoming and compassionate. I was actually sad when I had my last appointment; over the course of several weeks I'd come to look forward to going and chatting with the staff while undergoing physical therapy.

I would highly recommend this Benchmark location to anybody in Paulding County and the surrounding area!"
Absolutely love this place. I had a very extensive hip surgery. I was able to set up my appointment two days after my surgery. Kaytlyn is my physical therapist and she goes above and beyond to make sure every exercise has a purpose in helping with my healing process. All the therapist are super friendly and listen to what your needs are. Highly recommend this place.
"I‚Äôve had an excellent experience with Benchmark! They always greet me like an old friend. They listen to me and change things up to fit my needs. Brittany, my physical therapist, is awesome!!! She always finds the spots that are trouble and helps work them out. They send me home with things I can actually do that help. This location is highly recommended!"
"Thank you to everyone at BenchMark Dallas location.

I am very satisfied with all the treatment I received. You all made my daughter and I feel comfortable and confident with our Therapy process.

Michelle, Brittany, Leah, Anushka and Victoria, (all the staff there) are professional, courteous and maintains a well run friendly environment for your road to recovery.

I would recommend this location to anyone who needs Therapy after an accident."

"Amazing!!! Brittany and the team at Benchmark in Dallas are the best of the best in PT.  They are always friendly and professional while providing superior care and treatment, bar none.  They listen to what‚Äôs going on and create a plan to get you back on track.  Brittany‚Äôs instincts are on point and have literally given me back my mobility.  I wish I could give them 10 stars...highly recommend."
"Wonderful environment. Friendly and engaging staff. Hands-on treatment, very attentive and detailed! Getting you better is the teams goal! I give them a 10 of 10!"
"Wow!!! This location has the BEST, most professional & most knowledgeable physical therapists around!!! Plus is the remaining staff members are so pleasant & customer focused!!! Have to recommend Brittany Steele, especially for dry needling- she is truly gifted and her work on me has made me feel SO much better!"
Such a great atmosphere and wonderful staff! Everyone is very helpful and welcoming. The Pts were able to rehab my shoulder and prevent surgery! I am so thankful!!
"This Benchmark location is awesome!!! Each therapist gives you their best to help you get on the road to recovery!!! Michelle, Brittany, Leah, (physical therapists) Anushka (technician) and Victoria (office coordinator) are awesome!!! The temporary student techs are awesome as well!!! If you need physical therapy, I highly recommend this location!!! You will not be disappointed!!! Leah has been my therapist for a while now and she has me feeling so much better!!!"
Brittney and crew are wonderful!  Very knowledgeable and professional while providing a fun atmosphere to make the not so fun healing go so much better.
I just wanted to say thank you to the ladies at the Dallas location they are super friendly and caring and have been very helpful. I would recommend the Dallas location to anyone.
"Leah and Kaitlyn have gone out of their way to help me feel better . Great place , great service amd great atmosphere. I highly recommend"
"I highly recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy in Dallas, GA. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and are dedicated to the complete healing of their patients."
"As a patient for years, I trust the staff completely. Their attention to detail and interpersonal relationships make it worth your visits. If you want to improve your well-being and move from recovering to back-in-business, this is the crew you can trust."
"I came to Benchmark Dallas to finally get ahold of my low back muscle pain. Brittany took the time to assess my body and symptoms and we started a care plan to get my tense back, hip, and glute muscles to relax and yet get stronger. I'm grateful for her knowledgeable care and her team that assists her! My back mobility has increased, yay! The things I've learned about my back and how to care for it are like essentials in the body-care toolbox that I can use going forward for whenever it gets tense. I recommend PT at Benchmark Dallas to my friends. They'll make you feel at home!"
"I love this place, friendly, helpful, they do what it take to get you back on track with your life. Thank you gals/guys very much."
"I was treated here after a car accident and everyone was so friendly to me. It‚Äôs tough enough when you‚Äôre going through a hard time physically, but the staff here was very encouraging every step of the way. I‚Äôm very happy to say I made a full recovery and it always made me feel better coming in."
"Everyone was extremely helpful, positive, and friendly.  I was very happy with my results and highly recommend them.  Thank you BenchMark!!!!"
Bench mark is a great place with very friendly and professional staff
"My two daughters and I have been treated by Michelle and Brittany at different times since April 2018.
The entire office staff is friendly, helpful, kind, and supportive. Michelle‚Äôs knowledge of the human anatomy is amazing. Brittany‚Äôs grasp of each person‚Äôs individual concerns is precise and accurate. They both provide excellent physical therapy, giving each of us their undivided attention at every visit.
We feel listened to, understood, and supported in our paths to recovery. We leave the office feeling better physically, mentally, and emotionally.
The office is 20-25 minutes from our home, but the quality of care is why we make the trip. The care they provide is invaluable and very much appreciated. They are simply the best around."
"EXCELLENT!!!  The staff at Benchmark PT are outstanding!!! My son is a Varsity Athlete who recently received therapy for.a serious ankle injury. With the help of these knowledgeable professionals, he is now fit again and back in training. We will be forever grateful to all of members of this fantastic team."
"I cannot say enough good things about this practice.  Michelle and Co. are true professionals but are also very laid back people that make you feel right at home as soon as you walk in the door, day 1. Charlie at the front desk is a beautiful smiling face to greet you and every single tech in the place is phenomenal. Greg will make you feel better with a joke and his great compassion for people.  You will leave this place feeling so much better than when you arrived, inside and out. They are up to date on all of the latest physical therapy breakthroughs and Michelle (the director of the clinic) has continuing education for herself and the people that work for her.  You will know that you are receiving the very best care possible as soon as you meet your new therapists at Benchmark in Dallas Ga.  They will listen carefully to you and take very seriously your concerns.  You will know you‚Äôre being listened to and cared for properly.  I can‚Äôt thank them enough for their continued care for my frozen shoulder. I look forward to my visits every week!"
"This particular location wasn't the closest to me, but a friend recommended it and especially the services of Physical Therapist Michelle Tanner.  I'm so glad I took my friends advice.

Within a very short period, Michelle prescribed a regimen that has totally relieved me of pain that I had for over a year.  The entire crew is great.

I am thrilled with the results and service! Recommended without any hesitation."
"Knowledgeable. Innovative. Teamwork. Fun.
I've been a client and referred people to Michelle and her team since early 2018.  In January of this year (2019) my son required 3-mos of physical therapy to recover from a serious illness.   They never quit working with him and encouraging him.  It's clear to me that each person is treated as an individual for their particular issue.  This is NOT a ""do your exercises, see you next week PT office"".
You'll also find that they are trained in the latest treatment techniques.  I was willing to try anything to heal faster, and we found what worked.  It's also clear that the other PT's (Brittney) and staff are all on the same page and help each other out.
The only con - If you want an environment that is ""quiet and doctor office like"", then try a different place.  At this office, you'll have the support of the staff and other clients.
As a triathlete, trainer and coach I know how important it is to get the proper assistance as soon as possible to heal properly.

"Very attentive staff, friendly and supportive.  Really helping me after surgery."
My Husband was given 3 days to come in for his rotator cuff surgery.. He was assigned different Therapists each time. His last therapist was not effective and a little  disrespectful . We wkikl not pleased with his treatment




"I've been treated by several of the therapists at Benchmark PT during a couple of post-surgical rehab stints and they've all been super pleasant and compassionate, plus they really know what they're doing and have helped me recover faster than I thought I would.

I can't help myself... I just have to say that at Benchmark PT, the ""PT"" doesn't stand for ""Pain and Torture.""

BenchMark ROCKS!"
Very pleased with the service I received.  They know what they are doing.  Thank you.
"Great, friendly, and skilled staff who makes you feel at ease doing the exercises after my back surgery."
The staff is very friendly and professional. The facility is very clean and they sanitize after every patient. They truly care about their patients!
"I just finished therapy.  The staff is fantastic.  The exercises effective.  The therapists are caring and easy to get along with.  They are compassionate and really concerned.  All are great, but Kim and Kelly are my favorites.  They make you laugh through the pain.  Strongly recommend this therapy group."
I luv this place and the people.. my favorites r Callie and Tyler
"I was very impressed with Benchmark PT!!  When I was referred for  PT and called to make an appointment, the receptionist went overboard to help and get me in the schedule  ASAP!! They  were all very friendly,  courteous,  smiling and  happy!!  Tyler was awesome while giving me treatment!  I highly recommend Benchmark !!

Tyler was being ""shadowed"" by a student  ( Taylor) that is only  a few months away from completing her degree. It was obvious that Tyler  was excited to be involved and help Taylor be a success as well!!!
THANKS to you ALL  for your help!!!"
"About a month ago now, I sought a screening because my left foot was causing me problems that kept me from running. The staff there went above and beyond in assessing my issue and offering advice, such as recommending shoe brands, shoe types, running techniques to keep from further hurting my foot, and providing abundant information -- like what type of walker I was or what kind of foot arches I had. I was impressed with their knowledge and even enthusiasm; they provided me with a drawn diagram of how to run correctly and notes on the aforementioned details. They drew upon each other for input, displaying teamwork and respect for each other's expertise. They care for their craft and take pride in their work. The physical therapist who met with me initially did so during her lunch break! Excellent service, 10 out of 10 recommend!"
When it comes to getting good quality caring go to Benchmark üëç. Stuff is awesome and the way they treat you you want to do the exercises you want to push yourself to the limit. The clean everything and will answer any question you have explain whatever I love this place ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüß°üíöüíú Afra

"Excellent Staff and care. Got me going again with my knee and some other issues I had with neck,  back, shoulder. Love these guys."
"My time spent at Benchmark Physical Therapy was great! All of the therapists and receptionists are wonderful. They are all very friendly and welcoming, you don't really feel like you're at a doctor's office so to speak.

My sister went to them for both her knee surgeries, so when I had to have physical therapy for my heel and tendon, I chose Benchmark and was not disappointed at all. Everyone there cares about your progress and about you. If I ever need physical therapy again I will be sure to go back t Benchmark!"
Started going here after my knee replacement surgery last June and again in October. The staff at this location are wonderful and very helpful at getting me back to where I needed to be. And they make it a fun environment.
"Such a great place to get treatment after surgery. Post ACL surgery physical therapy wasn't easy, but the staff created a friendly environment that makes therapy fun! 100% recommend!"
"Had my 1st session for rotator cuff injury yesterday. Great staff. Friendly, patient, and dedicated. Wonderful experience."
1000% impressed with everyone from the girls up front dealing with my crazy insurance to the PT Tyler. I have complete confidence in Benchmark PT.

The individuals all learn nothing but positive attributes that help build and nurture better confindence. The staffs expertise is a definite must for any individual with special challenges and to gain back thier lives. I appreciate their efforts and kindness. Thank you very much for your wonderful services. Bonus: They make ones day filled with sunshine."
Therapists take time with you and listen to you. Staff is very friendly. I have gotten great results from my therapy.

"Highly recommend Ariane & Sebastian for your therapy needs!   Both are extremely attentive and make you work while providing you with at home tools. I am completely pain-free in my low back/hip and grateful to Ariane, Sebastian & Melissa!  You guys are the best!"
"Ariane, Jason and Sebastian were great! Very attentive, patient, personable and kind. I highly recommend this location!"
"The Chamblee crew is awesome. I was glad to work with this personable, professional, well-informed, and cohesive team. I believed that they cared about my well-being. They were patient as they evaluated me and at every session as they challenged me to progress. I have improved tremendously because of the therapists and the students who worked with me. If you need PT, Benchmark Chamblee is the place to go."
"Great experience! I dislocated my shoulder and pinched my radial nerve. Thanks to my physical therapist, Ariane Robinson and her team, I was able to recover my shoulder, arm, and fingers to its full potential again. Overall, their team treated me like family. Would go back again if I need any physical therapy again."
"Great experience at this PT office! Ruptured left ACL and torn right MCL mid-February and surgery for ACL delayed for 90 days due to Covid-19. Started PT with Andrea Cedeno-Tobon early March. Saw her twice a week up until end of May surgery. By then my MCL was repaired through therapy and the muscles around my ACL were noticeably strengthened (ortho staff was very impressed with my progress). Post surgery, returned to Andrea for twice per week ACL PT and 'graduated' early October. It was a long 7 months of therapy but I was able to go straight into workouts with a personal trainer at my gym post PT. At 42 yo, I didn't expect to regain full functionality but PT exceeded my expectations."
Great experience and staff!
"I highly recommend this particular BenchMark location.  I have worked with different physical therapists in recent years and my experience here was by far the best.  Andrea Cedeno-Tobon, the therapist I worked with, is knowledgeable, patient, attentive and very encouraging.  The rest of the staff was always welcoming and helpful.  My time there was successful and progress significant.  The space was always clean and well organized.  You cannot find a better place to heal."
"I have had a bad back for 18 years. I had 18 years of medicines and the old physical therapy where you do exercises all the time. *Benchmark physical therapy*  in Chamblee, Georgia had me try ‚Äúdry needling‚Äù ( it is not acupuncture).  ‚ÄúDry needling‚Äù uses hair thin needles that are flexible and they very carefully put them in your muscle for a minute or two. The relief was unbelievable! I‚Äôm glad I listened to their advice and tried it.

Almost a year later I came back because of my back hurting again. Their advice this time was to try ‚Äúcupping‚Äú  and I‚Äôm glad I did. For the sore and tight muscles that have developed over the  last few weeks were relieved by this new method of ‚Äúcupping‚Äú.  These people at *Benchmark are on the cutting edge of Physical Therapy* in my opinion. I would not go anywhere else.

Try *Benchmark first before you think of going anywhere else."
"Such a supportive, fun environment!  Staff was so positive, encouraging, and knowledgeable--helping me to make small tweaks to dramatically improve my everyday life.  Location is very convenient with easy parking.  Would certainly send a friend here."
"So thankful for this new Benchmark facility.  The lead  therapist, Brian,  is not only knowledgeable and skillful, he is also is kind and  attentive. He was very responsive to my problem, and used multiple different approaches to resolve it.  I had such a good experience, I've already sent my co-worker  there for her shoulder pain,  An added bonus - the parking is free and very easy."
Very helpful. Excellent instruction and overall support. Would definitely come again.



"Great place. Very professional group of people.  Angela is very knowledgeable, intuitive, and  attentive to my needs...  No matter how much pain I am in when I get there, I am always feeling some better by the time I leave. If you're looking for physical therapy,  you won't go wrong choosing this group."
The staff here is amazing they helped me get my insurance straightened out were more than accommodating at working through that hurdle savannah and Angela are amazing they went out of their way to help me Angela and Jeff always encouraging me and helping me recover the care you receive is phenomenal everyone in here is always pleasant and welcoming nothing but great things to say ty so much all of you I will always recommend people to come here for their care
Clean environment with knowledgeable and friendly personnel.
"PT Solutions was so helpful! Savanna was always kind enough to help me understand what my insurance covers. I love that I can drop in, call, and text the office anytime I have a question or wanted to schedule an appointment. They‚Äôre so accessible. Angela is so encouraging! She always listened to my concerns and fears. I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today without her. She taught me to walk again and I‚Äôm forever thankful. They‚Äôre the best!!!"
"Hi :) I moved here recently after being in recovery from an accident back in 2020. To say I was apprehensive about leaving my original physical therapy team in Louisiana would be an understatement. However, PT Solutions of Blue Ridge felt like family from the very first initial call I made to set up my treatments.
Savanna, the rockstar that runs the front desk (and SO much more), treated me with insane kindness throughout the setup process. Angela and Jeff have worked with me in so many ways to better my mobility, range of motion and strength. They will push you to get the job done so you can heal effectively and efficiently. I have only been a part of PT Solutions since January of 2021 but throughout that time I have healed in more ways than one. Physically and mentally. Every time I walk in the door I know I will be with family and a team of amazing individuals that I trust and respect. So head on down to PT Solutions of Blue Ridge and have a HEALarious good time!"
"Worst customer service ever.
I left in tears as i was treated with disresoect a d rudeness.
Never to go back."
"Do not go to PT solutions in Blue Ridge as they will go weeks without therapy then want you to come back and then they claim insurance won't cover past a month at a time.  How is it my fault when I asked when to schedule next visit and was told from Angela that I would receive a phone call from from Savanah and didn't receive any communication til Sept 21, 2020 after first visit on Sept 4, 2020 and Angela tells me it is my fault.  So please whatever you do find somewhere else for therapy needs."


A great place for PT! All the staff is friendly and professional! Facility is neat and clean and well equipped. Therapists are very knowledgeable and hands on to your needs. I would definitely recommend ATI! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
"I have been to several places for PT, but Joe at ATI has been superior in helping me gain strength and knowledge. The thing I appreciate about him is he works with me the entire time and adjusts my exercises to my constantly changing body. If some exercise has become too easy, he gives me another exercise that will challenge me. I highly recommend him for PT."
"You all do a good job,i like this place a lot better then the one i went to first.."
Allen and Sarah are the best. Took very good care of me and really pushed me to recover as much as I could. Absolutely fantastic experience across the board.
My husband has had a couple of knee replacements and these guys know there job well. They treated him and he did so well. And they are nice people too. And now I have had surgery and am now going there and they do such a marvelous job. I recommend them highly
"I am more than pleased with ATI.  From the moment we walked in the door I was impressed with the cleanliness and layout of the facility.  My initial evaluation was performed by Hannah who unfortunately has moved to a Calhoun, GA office.  This in no way dimishes the quality of an evaluation or treatment.  There are a number of individuals who are more than capable of evaluting your condition and preparing a regimen to get you back to where you need to be.  The entire staff is personable and professional from the front desk personnel and including all therapists.  I worked with Sarah initially.  She was thorough and made sure I was performing each exercise correctly.  The majority of my treatment was directed by Mike.  He was excellent to work with.  Very pleasant and communicative.  I liked that if one therapist got busy or delayed with another patient any other therapist who was not busy would step in and help until the primary therapist returned.  I have no hesitation in recommending ATI.  They are a cut above the rest."
Very thorough. Everyone is very nice. I haven‚Äôt had much physical therapy however it seems ATI knows what they are doing.
I came here for an ankle injury and I was put with Hannah. She is the sweetest person and really pushes me to get better! I have only been going a few weeks but already feel a difference. I love coming here!
They really good  at what they do!! I  have a good  experience with them . So far  i have been there  3 times. Very  professional.
The staff is very friendly and helpful. I was a patient here for 5 weeks. At every visit I felt like I belonged. Everyone that was there during my visits seemed very pleased with their therapists as well. My therapist was alway their to help and encourage me through the sessions. I will recommend ATI therapy to everyone I know that is needing physical therapy.
"I had my first knee replacement surgery in August of last year and ATI was recommended by two friends. After surgery Matt, Sarah and Hannah worked with me to regain mobility.  They were very professional, caring and showed great compassion and you could tell that they really enjoyed helping people. So, when the time came in December for my second knee replacement surgery there was never a doubt where I was going for my Physical Therapy. Again, Hannah and Sarah worked to help me regain flexibility in my knee.  Now I am back on the job (firefighter) and working out again. Thanks to Matt, Hannah and Sarah for caring.  I highly recommend ATI for anyone having knee replacement surgery.

Thanks  H. Randy Camp"
"Alan does a fantastic job.  He is very knowledgeable,
sincere, easy to talk to, and great at his profession !
I‚Äôd recommend him every time"
"ATI in Ringgold is great!!!! ATI is actually off 2A Battlefield Parkway behind Farm to Fork. All staff members are friendly and knowledgeable. Hannah and Sarah have helped me immensely. In 3 weeks I went from not being able to lift my left arm up above my head to being able to and can actually pull my hair up into a ponytail with little effort. I am looking at having knee replacement surgery in the near future and will definitely be coming here for my therapy.
I will recommend this facility to everybody."
Love Ryan. Very informative and takes his time. While being very time efficient.
Everyone at the Ringgold ATI really has your best interest at heart. Relationships are made that help the patient feel comfortable with the Physical Therapist.  ATI is my place of choice!  This is my third time to go to ATI with a different issue and I couldn‚Äôt be happier.
The therapist are great. They seem to know what there doing. The only thing is they need more help I think. When I'm there I don't get the one on one because they are usually seeing 2 patients at a time but other than that it's ok. The PTA that works with me knows what she is doing so she gets a 5 star.
Allen is fantastic! He makes you feel comfortable and is very effecient! I have never had to wait more than just a few minutes for my appt time and I feel that speaks volumes to how this practice runs!
Great PT at ATI! Therapists and staff are very knowledgeable and so friendly. Happy I made the choice to continue my therapy there!
Friendly and knowledgeable staff. They do a great job getting you to where you need to be.
My back gave out about 5 weeks and Hannah and Sarah have been amazing. They are amazing and if you need PT I highly recommend ATI in Ringgold. You won‚Äôt regret itü•∞
"Had a great experience. The staff there is friendly, and definitely very helpful. I worked with Matt, and he did really great job!"
"It was frustrating when they said to be here at 7:40 a.m.
And they don't open till 8"
This was not my first visit with ATI. I came back again because the staff is awesome and so caring and friendly. They are respectful of the injury that the patient has. I would recommend them to anyoneüòÉ‚ÄºÔ∏è
All the staff are nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place for all physical therapy needs.
The staff is caring and my therapy is going extremely well.
"Everyone nice and courteous,  thank you."
I always have an excellent physical therapy experience at ATI. My therapist is kind and thoughtful. She gives me exactly the exercises that I need to strengthen my back after spinal fusion surgery.
Matt is the best. Highly recommend.
"Very professional staff.  Concerned with your well being.  Sarah, Matt, Allen are all wonderful.  Would recommend this place to anyone."
Very nice people and areal nice place to get your therapy done
Staff really nice when ever i come in and Allen is the best.
After a long period of pretty much knowing I needed surgery.  Matt at the Ringgold office and I came to the same conclusion.  Better let the doc look at it again. I appreciate the fact that he was not going to force something on me that wasn't going to be helpful. After getting the MRI needed to determine yes indeed I did need surgery. Now after the Surgery I am back and happy to say Matt is the therapist I chose to help me through this long process. I have had pt in the past and I must say his level of understanding the human anatomy is impressive.  As well as the fact he takes the time even late in the evening to help in a very professional manor. The whole staff at the Ringgold office are great to be around and make you feel welcomed. Great to have such a place in Georgia.
"The staff at Ringgold ATI physical therapy are professional, knowledgeable, friendly and fun. The atmosphere is very pleasant and inviting. I had a hip replacement and was treated with care and concern by all the team. I met my goals in the time allotted for my care and will definitely go back there for any other physical therapy needs. Thanks  ATI"
Physical therapist are very detail-oriented
Matt is doing a good job with my rehab.
"The staff at ATI in Ringgold is awesome.   My therapist, Alan Holmes, works hard to help me do my best. I would recommend ATI to all of my friends and family."
Everyone is so nice and helpful
"I have spent about a month here working on my knee. The staff is amazing and make you feel like a part of the family. You feel very comfortable but still at a very professional level. I was hurting bad enough to think I had torn something in my knee and now they have be back up and running literally. Thank all of you for your time and have work, the personal touch does make a big difference!"
Very professional and caring staff!
Ati is the best I have receive treatments several times on my Shoulder and back and neck.  I have different  therapist working with me and all have been great. This time around is for my neck and I feel that it is helping me.
I really like ATI in Ringgold.  Matt and Kayne are great.  Really helped my back.
"I just completed my PT here on a LONG road of issues with a foot fusion. Amazed and elated over the attention, care and expertise received from Matt and Cain. Thanks guys!! Highly recommended!!"
Everyone is so kind. I truly feel like they care about helping me get better.
Very friendly and helpful.
All of the staff is very friendly and helpful. Amy and Justin are great. This is my second time using this clinic and have nothing but great things to say.
"My daughter and I have both used ATI in Ringgold over a span of many years for a variety of issues, including sports injuries, broken bones, surgeries and to alleviate back pain.  Matt Murray and his team are phenomenal!  They are easy to talk to, listen to what you are saying and develop a plan to get you back to your best performance.  They are all very professional and are truly caring individuals.  We always request to go to ATI Ringgold as we know the level of care we will get with each visit.  Thank you for all that you do!"
"The staff was friendly and made you feel welcome. They even go above and beyond to get you where you need to be. I thank Elizabeth, Sarah, and Kayne for everything they have done for me. I will always recommend them and if needed to have therapy again, I'll be back"
"Very friendly staff. My therapist, Shannon, is awesome. She knows just how hard to push for the results I need. A great experience!"
Everyone here is so helpful and nice. Everyone who works here always makes you feel great.
They worked  to get my back and hip back to her I could work they were great I really appreciate  every thing they have done  for me
"i have been with ATI for about 5 years on and off, i definitely recommend coming to this location! they have the best staff, and make you feel like family! :)"
The staff and taskes I'm asked to do are spot on and eventhough I'm really hurting they understand .. I feel at home there.
"I have been to the ATI Physical Therapy location since 2015 for different injuries or surgeries.. Previously when I needed therapy I was sent to other therapy facilities that my doctors referred me too. The ATI in Shorewood is 5 minutes from my home and I was told by another patient that they went to the Shorewood ATI location and they were very happy with all the staff and the outcome of their treatment. So in 2015 I went to the Shorewood therapy facility for therapy after surgery. All I can say is I am so happy I chose to go there. All of the staff are so profeessional, knowledgeable, friendly and genuinely concerned about your issue. And what I really like is  that  I see the same therapists and staff and a few new ones since I started going there, which is so nice because they know you and it feels so nice that you are welcomed back by all. And the best part of the experience is when I finish therapy I know that therapy was a success. So thank you to everyone at ATI Shorewood for making me feel welcome and confident that I will get the care I need."
Elizabeth and Sarah are great !  Very knowledgeable and helpful.
Great staff works with you and your budget!
Great people! Have helped me out tremendously!!




















"This is as good as a physical therapy practice gets, in this view. It's everything you want: medically comprehensive, and thoroughly cordial. It's personal versus impersonal. And it's 1,000 percent professional. Five-star and then some, thanks to Ashley, Kelci, and Shari."
"After shoulder surgery, hand and wrist surgery I was prescribed physical therapy.  After trying another PT provider for months I switched to Benchmark on Saint Simons. The smaller more personalized office was perfect. I made much more progress at Benchmark.  From Sherry at the front desk to Kelli and Ashley the Therapists the atmosphere was great. Kelli and Ashley are experienced, fully trained and qualified and their good nature makes the visits a wonderful experience."
So I have been a patient for a second go around and talk about great. These ladies are amazing they take care of each person with kindness and care. You can not ask for a better group of ladies. It's wonderful to know the level of professionalism and care they show each patient.
"The staff at BenchMark Physical Therapy are the best! I just moved to Georgia from the Northeast and was worried about finding a place to rehabilitate and progress after surgery, but they are so welcoming and have already helped me improve tremendously. They are all so friendly and are just as in invested (if not more) in helping you get back to where you want to be!"
"My experience there has been fantastic.  Both Ashley and Kelci are great therapists, as well as kind and entertaining.  Besides recuperating, we have a lot of fun.  Sheri is a great receptionist and super helpful, also.  I would recommend Benchmark, SSI very highly for physical therapy."
"I can't say enough positive things about my experience with Benchmark PT on St. Simons Island. The staff and therapists are super friendly, knowledgeable, and make your time there fun and engaging while helping you recover. I am so happy that I chose to go here for my PT needs."
Love this place! Ashley along with all of the other physical therapists are super sweet and wonderful!! Overall has such a great atmosphere and you can tell that everyone works their hardest to help you in any way that they can!
"Excellent, individual & professional therapy. The Therapists & staff helped me achieve positive results in my after surgery therapy."
"The staff at benchmark on Saint Simons Island are amazing! They‚Äôre super friendly and very attentive to my needs.  They work hard in my recovery process from my injury.  They are very attentive  to my needs, and continue to help me on my road of recovery. Great job Chelsi!!!  Thank you!!!"
"Excellent therapy, customer service and care."
"5 star all around.  Very knowledgable and caring staff. They really care about their patients, provide education and have a very positive environment to recoup-rehab in.  A+ - Thank you!"
"Friendly, knowledgeable staff who really know how to best work with their clients. They are little, healing angels!!!"
"I love the whole staff, so great to work with!"
"Tony is Exceptional!  Very patient, thorough & focused!      Crystal, the receptionist, is Wonderful!   The location is convenient and conducive environment for physical therapy."



We enjoyed the staff and our team of Doctors. They cared and we were treated personally. Elizabeth H was an amazing nurse. The entire staff was great even if they didn't work with her. Everyone was good to us we enjoyed our entire stay. The entire staff was wonderful.
"Sara was terrific! She was always prepared with new exercises, and was very patient and fun! Very helpful! Like the atmosphere there also."
"Benchmark PT, on N. Decatur @ Clairmont, is the absolute best. They really helped make my healing process a smooth one. They‚Äôre professional & so kind to everyone who walks through the door. I will refer all of my family & friends to Benchmark PT. Ask for John or Wes - they‚Äôre amazing!"
"Great team! I really enjoyed working with Kyla, Wes, and Jon! Thank you."
"I scheduled an appointment after a recent shoulder surgery and showed up 30 minutes early as they requested only to find out they had no record of me  and had no appointment for me after providing all of my information and insurance over the phone.   Was supposed to start PT exactly 4 weeks after surgery but now have to scramble to find someone to fit me in to get started.  Very non-chalant response to their mistake.  ""Oops.  We'll re-schedule for another week"" doesn't work for me.   Don't waste your time."
"Sarah was amazing, encouraging, and very knowledgable of the treatment I needed. I recommend seeing Sarah you will be will pleased, she is very caring and the best person there. I won't see anybody else but her!"
I have done PT with Benchmark before and I believe their therapists are great! I do love this particular location as the staff is all very supportive and seem to work well together which makes the environment more welcoming.
Eli was awesome!  He knows his stuff. My right knee is so much stronger after 4 weeks. No pain at all. All the staff is very knowledgeable and they work to get you better and stronger.
"The staff at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Decatur are an amazing group of people. They are kind, considerate of your feelings, and make you want to do well. They push you to get better...but in a good way. I was always happy to go to therapy. My therapist was John Ross...pushing me to to my best, but with kindness. Thank you so very much John, Brenda, Sarah, and Anjanette!"
"Staff is very courteous, Wesley was professional ,knowledgeable when I started my knee was very weak cramps everyday  now it's strong my balance is better I can climb stairs without pain. Thank you BrenchMark.."
"I worked with Eli, he gave me exercise to do at home. He challenged me while I was there. After a few sessions I was in better shape then I was when I went in. Thank You Benchmark for always good service facility is extremely clean as well. I seen them clean after each person use of equipments. Very important in mist of Covid."
"My care was excellent.  Sarah Fasolino, my therapist was patient and persistent with me to see that my therapy goals were reached.  I spent 22 sessions there, much needed sessions for my total knee replacement surgery physical therapy.  The therapy was tough, but successful. And while I still have some strengthening to do, I am far better off due to the care, compassion and competence of those to whom my care was entrusted."
"After my car accident, I felt that my back/ shoulder area wouldn‚Äôt get better considering the fact that I already had previous back injuries. Coming to this location changed that. The staff/providers were only concerned with going my pace while targeting my injury to induce the proper healing, and supplied me with feedback that ultimately helped me recover. They have great customer service and keep things pretty clean/ sanitary given the current pandemic. Everybody kept their mask on and wiped off equipment immediately before and after use. I had an excellent experience here, thank you!"
"Anjanette was absolutely the best therapist ever!  She really provided the best care and expertise on getting me back on track to recovery...and strengthening. I always looked forward to my visits because I knew I was making progress as result of treatment and homework (exercise) assignments.  Brenda at the front desk was always so professional, jolly, and welcoming. Thank you to the team! I had the best experience!"
My daughter had PT sessions w/Alex for both her back and her shoulder. He was awesome!! I would definitely recommend Benchmark PT to all my family and friends. I have also gone to their other location off of Chastain. They never disappoint great work and friendly staff!!! An A++++
"I had an excellent experience with Benchmark Decatur. My therapist, Anjanette, was professional, knowledgeable, and very capable, and she brought me a measure of relief for my insane bursitis when nothing else would. I‚Äôve since been able to finally get my issue under control but would definitely go back if I were to break myself again."
"This place is top notch.  I was seen by both Sarah Fasolino, PT, DPT, the clinic director, and also by Lacy who was training under Sarah‚Äôs supervision.  Both were extremely kind and professional.  Sarah seemed highly experienced and knowledgeable.  After a couple visits I was fully confident in her abilities and realized that she likely had treated my type of injury numerous times before.  She provided very specific exercises to strengthen specific muscle groups in my core, hips, and lower back.  I got the sense that the treatment was highly customized.

It believe most, if not all of the therapists, are trained to the doctorate level.  All the therapists appeared very calm, confident, and professional.

The facility took COVID precautions seriously, which was especially important to me.  Everyone, providers and office staff, were all masked.  Temperature checks were performed upon arrival.  Beds/tables were wiped down between patients.  Obviously providers need to come close to you for things like massage or to assess muscle strength, but I got the sense that they were doing the best they can under these pandemic circumstances.

I would recommend Benchmark Decatur to anyone in need of physical therapy."
"Great place for therapy, I enjoyed the experience and will come back for a following.
Thanks"
I highly recommend Jonathan Ross at the Decatur location of Benchmark Physical Therapy.
"When I started seeing Anjanette I was having constant migraines and could barely move my head and neck. Through constant discussion of what worked specifically for me, she helped feel better than I have in years. I have no pain, and did NOT have to have surgery or injections. Wonderful care all around!"
"Highly highly recommend!! Recently had surgery about 2 months ago and my recovery is going great. The entire staff is absolutely wonderful, especially my two physical therapists Sarah and Raakhee. They really goes above and beyond to ensure that I‚Äôm healing correctly and push me in a positive way to meet my goals. Dyanna also really helps boosts moral and keeps all the patients with a smile on their face. From check in to check out this place is absolutely wonderful. 5 stars for my new adopted family."
"Love this team! They are amazing. After my car accident, they worked with me for months to make sure I was back to normal. They listened to exactly what was wrong and made sure I wasmwas my recovery goals."
"I had low expectations when I started treatment.
Working with the professional team at Benchmark Physical Therapy helped restore the confidence I needed to do the necessary work for my recovery.

Thousand Thanks"
"Wonderful experience,, great staff, all the therapists are very smart and know there stuff, and the receptionist is so very efficient."
"Allison has been the best therapist I've ever had.  She listened to all my issues and has taken me from being wobbly with some pain in my knees to being very strong with no pain.  I'm 74 with osteo arthritis under my kneecaps.  My balance is so much better and my legs are really strong.  Allison is very patient, kind and knows what she is doing."
"Seems to be a solid standard of professionalism, competence and client comfort, across the board."
I love coming in because my therapy was very hard the first couple of visits but as Rocky and the staff worked with me everything got easier and my pain level went down very fast and i like the way everything that i was doing was explained to me why i was doing the movements. i have to say a great place to come for physical therapy!!!
"I have no idea if the therapists are good or not because I couldn't get an appointment made due to their incompetent front desk. Since they were convenient to my home I stopped by in person and was told they couldn't see me unless I had a referral, and I would need to call my doctor. Never asked to look at my insurance or any other questions. My plan has no referral required. I had Rachel from Cigna call them and she confused Rachel as well. The person I spoke to (Siena?) has very poor communication skills and could care less. I'm making the assumption that the therapists are a reflection of the pitiful front office staff so I will go elsewhere"
"I used this facility first in 2014 for an injured knee. The results were great. I love the whole neighborhood, easy access, make you feel like family approach. Very helpful and healing. I am now rehabbing from a knee replacement/tendon repair surgery and receiving the same high quality service."
Benchmark at North Decatur and Clairmont is a good place!


"I recently had therapy at Benchmark Macedonia! Kevin was my primary therapist and Kevin certainly helped with with my recovery! Kevin is excellent with his therapy skills and rehab ability! Kevin is knowledgeable and thorough! Everyone who works here are very professional and dedicated to all their patients! From the moment you walk in to Benchmark, you are greeted by Katie or one of the staff members! Benchmark staff makes you always feel comfortable and caring about your individual needs!
Thank you for being here and so close to my home! I certainly recommend Benchmark to our community!"
"Paige, Kevin and the entire staff are incredible at this location. I highly recommend.  I had three times in the last two years I needed their help. I greatly improved because of their caring, detailed expertise."
"I have been going to this Benchmark Physical Therapy location since June 2020 and was finally able to discharge yesterday after 110 visits! I predominantly used Kevin and I can‚Äôt say enough good things about him. He was very knowledgeable about my cases and what I needed along with being very kind, gentle, and understanding to the constant changes in the healing process. He helped nurse me back to full health from being non weight bearing on crutches 3 separate times (two right knee surgeries and 1 left knee surgery) and always kept me motivated and positive during some very difficult and trying times. Katie was always very on top of things and accommodating to all of my scheduling needs along with always being so willing to do the dirty work with insurance. Paige always made sure that I was able to get the care and treatment that I needed and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for that. I got to know everyone very well and it felt very ‚Äúhomey‚Äù walking in and being greeted every week. As ironic as it sounds, I will miss seeing them so often as they have been a huge part of my life and journey this last year plus. I‚Äôll forever be grateful to everyone at this clinic and would recommend them to anyone!"
"After my C-spine C3-C4 surgery to repair the damage caused by a distracted driver running a red light and plowing into my car, Paige worked hard to get me out of pain and muscle spasms, and back to full range of motion.  She did it with a rare blend of bright and pleasant confidence, loads of experience, and a clear objective-based approach with hands-on work (which for some reason many PT therapists seem to avoid) including some dry needling.  I've had a lot of PT due to sports and other injuries, and Paige is one of the best.   Thanks so much to her, and to Katie as well for always being on top of appointments and staying flexible when changes were necessary.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Benchmark PT in Macedonia."
Benchmark Macedonia is more than a 5 star. Its100 star plus Paige is extremely knowledgeable and improved my shoulder/ neck function immensely. Paige is caring and knows how far to push each individual for healing and improvement. Because of Paige the experience in the building is upbeat and extremely positive. No matter howbusy the front desk is Katie always has time for you. I have not worked worked with the other therapist Kevin. But I have seen him work with his patients. He is professional and patient and makes a difference also This office gives you the will and strength to improve. The half hour drive each way is more than worth it
I've been coming here before and after surgery for a herniated disk. Everyone is super friendly and knowledgeable. Really recommend this location to anyone searching for PT.
I definitely recommend this place. They are so kind and patient and it‚Äôs such a pleasant environment! Both my kids love it!!
"I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with the results I received from Benchmark physical therapy in Woodmont Village Macedonia. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful from Kevin and Paige to the receptionist..... I had never heard about dry needling before, but I a believer in it now!  Thanks guys!!"
"The staff was amazing and very polite, they cared for me throughout my experience there."
"Everyone in the location was friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Paige is an awesome therapist. She really listened to me and constantly worked to tweak my treatment."
"Paige, Kevin, and Katie were all great; top notch staff, service, and care. Highly recommend, went for PT after rotator cuff surgery, shoulder is doing great! Good folks."
"I have a rare and untreatable neuromuscular disease and am near the time when I no longer will be able to walk.  The manager and part owner, Paige took the time to study my disease and develop a tailored routine, appropriate to my disease. Previous enterprises simply employed a one-size-fits-all approach and I soon dropped out.

While Physical Therapy is work, thanks to the dedicated staff, I have come to look forward to it. They have become to be like family and I always sense their caring. I have observed them with other clients and they are always professional. I am certain that I would be far worse by now, where it not for their intervention.

I hope if you are in need of PT, you would give them a chance to help you."
An amazing team that's easy to connect with and talk to. They really listen to your needs and do their best to help you.
"I am currently going to Benchmark for a major knee surgery and I have gone to PT in the past several times for different injury rehabs and I can tell you that the team here is second to none, from the minute you walk in the door Katie meets you and makes you feel welcome and is great at working with your schedule to book, Paige is an out standing therapist as is Kevin and their assistant Peyton. You are going to therapy , but you are also going to a wonderful friendly environment where there‚Äôs great conversation and they have a great Covid-19 protocol if that is something you worry about!
You won‚Äôt be disappointed with your rehab success or the friendships you bond while rehabbing üòÉ"
"Good folks, do recommend for PT"
"Not enough good things to say about this location. I've fighting through some tough conditions and all of the the folks here have been super helpful especially Page and Katie. I drive past at least 5 other PT offices between BenchMark Macedonia and my home, and would never consider switching."
I couldn't imagine working for any other company!! Definitely the most welcoming and helpful team members I've ever worked with!! Come see us :)
I‚Äôve been taking my daughter for several weeks now and all of the staff are so friendly and warm. She has had significant improvement so far and actually looks forward to going.
"This is such a fantastic place to receive care!  Each one of the staff members are very caring and friendly.  It is obvious that they are passionate about helping people heal and get back to doing what they love.  Due to the severity of my problem, I wasn't getting immediate relief, but they didn't give up.  Paige kept trying different approaches to figure out exactly how to help.  She ended up referring me to another health care professional that was able to get my spinal cord lined up to heal the nerves that were damaged.  The staff seem to genuinely enjoy what they do and have created an environment where they respect each other and work well together.  I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone!"
I highly recommend Benchmark at Macedonia.  Kevin and all the staff are great...very welcoming and helpful.
"I highly recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy at Macedonia Woodmont . Kevin as well as the rest of the team are knowledgeable, caring and very supportive. They are well qualified. They helped me reach my goal of strengthening my knee where I could walk without pain. I felt well cared for and so glad  I put my trust in them. They are the best!"
"The staff is welcoming and extremely helpful.  They explain the exercises thorough and ensure that you are doing them correctly.  If they give you at home, they provide resources to use to ensure that you are doing them the right way.  We love this facility."
"I am currently working for Benchmark Physical Therapy to further my education before entering physical therapy school! I have been working here for two months and I have learned so much from Paige and Kevin. They are such great teachers and even better Physical Therapists for Benchmark. Since starting my job here, I have reassurance that I am entering a field that I love. Kevin and Paige are examples of what I want to be in the future, and the clinic itself has encouraged me to own my own clinic one day! Love the community here and can‚Äôt wait to continue working here!"
Great facility and great people!
Paige and her staff are awesome. I started going to Paige when she was in the Buford clinic and have since followed her (which should say a lot considering I drive 45min one way to see her). She helped me after my back surgery and continues to do dry needling for me.
"I have had a very pleasant experience.  Each person who works at this facility is great!  I have had physical therapy at another facility for lower back pain in the past with no success.  The exercises Paige and Joel gave me to do were different from those I had done in the past, and these have worked.  I was given personal instruction during each session to be sure that I was using the correct technique for each exercise.  I feel as though I graduated today with honors from the program they prescribed.  I would highly recommend Macedonia BenchMark to everyone."
"Paige is very knowledgable, attentive, and provides excellent care! She has helped me with our family‚Äôs physical therapy needs/questions for years. Highly recommend!"
My experience at BenchMark in Macedonia has been wonderful! I entered with sever lower back pain due to herniated discs and I am leaving at 100%! Paige and staff are very responsive and caring. Highly recommend!
"With a success rate of only 50%, spinal fusion surgery followed by physical therapy was a difficult decision to make.  Thankfully, having Dr. Paige Hanson as my physical therapist made my recovery successful!  I have never had a physical therapist (and I had many before the surgery) who actually listens to me and adjusts the therapy for my needs.  I always knew that my success was very important to her.  Thank you, Paige!  You are the BEST!"
I have been seeing the staff at Benchmark - Woodmont rehabbing from two shoulder surgeries. Everything is great and I am progressing as planned. The staff are friendly and helpful. I highly recommend Benchmark.
"I highly recommend making an appointment with Dr. Paige Hanson at Benchmark in Canton! Paige is professional, knowledgeable and friendly! She has given me so much support to help relieve my back and leg pain in addition to gaining my strength. I am so thankful for all she has done! The support staff in Canton is also wonderful."
I have been a patient for Benchmark and am also an employee. I love working here and I love being part of a team that is helpful! We are effective with our treatments and want you to be a member of the family! Physical therapy can be effective for many people with all sorts of conditions. Come by and see us!
We strive to exceed expectations here at BenchMark Physical Therapy. Please feel free to stop in and see me for a free screening or to answer any questions you may have!  We offer a wide variety of interventions from dry needling to post operative care to treatment for vertigo - among other things. We would love to serve you!
Awesome staff (especially Hannah simpson!) and a great environment! Thankful for all of the staff for helping my get back from an injury!
Very pleased with my results from Paige and crew at Benchmark Macedonia.  I had been having pain for months.  I had tried another PT in Alpharetta and had no improvement.  Decided to try Paige and Benchmark and within 5 weeks my pain was gone.  Warm and friendly team that honestly cares.  Highly recommended.
"I thought I would never see my competing days again. After suffering from lower back pain for about one year, I decided to go through Benchmark Physical Therapy to help me deal with the on going problem I had. While only being 21 at the time, I thought my back pain would follow me the rest of my life. Thanks to Paige and her staff I am able to continue pursuing my active lifestyle as well as play with my daughter without feeling any pain!"
"I‚Äôve had upper back pain come out of nowhere a couple of times where it tends to creep up to my neck, not a great feeling. I went to go see Paige to assist me in relieving the pain. She was great at asking me questions on when it hurt, what movements caused it, etc. in order to figure out what the best option was for me. What helped the most was the dry needling, I was terrified at first but it released the pressure and made my pain go away!! It‚Äôs been several months and it has not come back! She is flexible and Benchmark Macedonia is my go to next time I‚Äôm feeling pain and I highly recommend!"
Very friendly staff and great atmosphere. Definitely recommend to anyone in the area!
The people are great and I got back to feeling good quickly
"This is a great place and it helps me a lot. I have a rare disease called FA and this helps me get through it, plus the people and their personalities always give me a smile."
Paige is a very knowledgeable and attentive physical therapist. She tailored a treatment to address my low back pain and I've maintained lasting relief. Thank you!
I was in a car accident  last September and was in so much pain I can say that with my physical therapist paige's help I am know able to return  to most of my normal  activities  the staff is warm and welcoming  from the moment  you step foot in the door you feel like you are part of a family  that wants the best for you
Very friendly place! I have always enjoyed my expierences here! I highly recommend to anyone looking for a PT
"I am absolutely amazed at the transformation I've had with my back while seeing Paige ! I had given birth to my son , and it completely destroyed any ab and back strength causing so much pain , some days I couldn't even play with my son . About a month later my back it's night and day with my back ! I'm able to play with my son , and do activities that I wasn't able to do before without intolerable pain ! Thank you so much Paige for all of the amazing help you've provided me with !!! You've definitely changed my every day life!!"
Paige is professional and extremely knowledgeable! Highly recommended


"This entire team is phenomenal from the front office staff to the techs and therapists. I was a patient for almost 2 months, and I looked forward to my PT appointments. The atmosphere is unlike what you would expect at a doctors office - open, fun, sometimes goofy, and very friendly even between patients. Everyone was so friendly and helpful in helping my shoulder heal. I absolutely will use Benchmark PT again. Laura, Ashley, Daniel, and team - Y'ALL ROCK!!"
The people at BenchMark in Hiram are so friendly amd helpful. They do there best to keep you out of pain and help you feel better. I highly recommend coming to Benchmark in Hiram ga.
"Very professional.  They take your temperature as soon as you walk in and wipe down equipment after each use.  I have been seeing the therapist three times a week since the beginning of July for my knee replacement.  Daniel and Ashley have been working with my knee to get my range of motion back.  They are not the type of therapist who feel that creating pain on the patient is the way to go.  I do my exercises and then they perform what needs to be done ie. message calf, stretching, needling, and getting the knee cap to move.  The front office staff and techs have been great at keeping me schedule and helping me out with referrals.  Highly recommend Benchmark."
"Dr. Jansky and support team were outstanding in my recovery from shoulder surgery.  I progressed faster than my surgeon expected and am enabled to continue strengthening the shoulder post treatment in a safe and efficient manner.  The facility was always clean and the team welcoming!  Any questions that I had were answered quickly.   Highly recommend this team of professionals!  Very grateful to them for helping me lead a pain free, activity filled life again!"
"I was in a motorcycle accident on June 20, 2020 and was left bed-bound with a very broken spine. I began physical therapy on August 10 and this had been the biggest blessing in my recovery. Ashley Eye, my therapist, has been incredible to me. She's patient, charismatic, gentle, and so much more. Furthermore, the techs Vicky and Kiandra are just as wonderful and helpful. I attribute my recovery to the wonderful folks at Benchmark in Hiram."
"This place is very clean, professional, & they adhere to the CDC guidelines for Covid-19.  Everyone is very nice and assists with your therapy but Ashlea is my go to therapist. She's nice but will push you until you recover."
I love this place and the people. They are so awesome! I recommend this place to everyone. I love the family vibe hereüíú  They treat everyone so special. I lovvveeee ittttüíú
"Incredible people work here. Karna helped me work with my insurance, Vicky is always SUPER helpful, and Daniel is such an awesome PT. Couldn't ask for a better PT experience."
This is my fourth different physical therapy practice and my last. Daniel has done more for me in three visits than any of the other practices  I visited.  I wish I‚Äôd gone to them two years ago. Everyone in the office is helpful and very nice. Daniel is a great therapist.
This is such an AMAZING place!!  They take such good care of our 8 year old son who recently broke his arm and is here for PT!  Daniel and the team here are so incredible.  A+++
Ashley and the whole staff are the best! Thanks for all your help!
I have been coming here on and off for 3 years.  The staff is very professional and friendly and they take their time with every patient to address their needs. I highly recommend them!!
"I was kicked by my horse on Oct. 19 2019, I was able to start therapy on Dec 16. I arrived in my wheel chair and met my therapist, Laura Jansky. By the end of March  2020 I was back on the horse with my brace.  I was able to finish therapy in Sept .   This spring I had some hip issues, I went right back to them.  I am feeling great, and thankful to have had them in my life.  Thanks to Laura, Dan and the techs I have my life back. Everyone encouraged me through the difficult times of healing. There is always a warm greeting when you walk thru the door. The clinic is clean and safe.  No worries going  during the covid outbreak.  BenchMark Physical Therapy is family."
I sustained an ankle injury going on 2 months ago and had my first PT appointment yesterday. As someone who suffers from mild social anxiety I was dreading being thrown into an unfamiliar situation. I was put at ease from the moment that I walked through the door. The entire staff was awesome and made me feel so comfortable. I ended up at this office on accident but I am so glad that I did. I look forward to completing the rest of my recovery with this team.
"Awesome staff, very clean and great environment!"
Very wonderful staff at the Hiram location.
"I want to thank the staff at BenchMark for their friendliness,  knowledge, and professionalism. They set a pace that I could work with and encouraged me to work hard to regain my mobility. I truly appreciate your help in my recovery. I would recommend BenchMark to anyone needing Physical therapy."
I had my first appointment today and they are fantastic!!The therapist put my mind at ease as to what I can do to to get back to my healthy goal..So glad I picked Benchmark in Hiram I felt so welcome and comfortable there!!
Excellent experience! Professional and caring staff that continuously provided motivation throughout the recovery process. Met every rehabilitation milestone thanks to encouragement and diligent efforts offered by Hiram BenchMark staff. Very accommodating schedule and friendly front desk staff. Strongly recommend their services!
Great service
I‚Äôve been coming here for almost a month. Everyone is super friendly and very inviting. The treatments I receive are amazing and I am improving significantly. I would recommend benchmark physical therapy to all my friends and family.
Two of the best decisions I've made: having my knee replaced and choosing Benchmark for physical therapy. The staff at Benchmark Physical Therapy Hiram have helped me regain not only my physical ability to use my knee again but also my confidence. I would highly recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy to anyone.
"Thank you to Daniel and the Benchmark Team in Hiram.  A month ago I was in the worse pain of my life from arthritis, heel and foot spurs.  The hands on therapy, stretching and take home exercises in addition to hydrotherapy has allowed me to spend 8 hrs walking almost 7 miles and standing in lines at amusement parks during my vacation.  I‚Äôve been through numerous PT‚Äôs over the past 15 yrs and this is the only one that I look forward to visiting because I‚Äôm getting results and decreasing my need for pain meds.  My quality of life has increased significantly."
I went here for about a month everyone of the therapist are awesome.
I went to this location first. Then went to 2 other locations. This location is very lazy and they suck. If I wanted to work out myself I would of just stayed at home.

"All of the staff are very helpful and professional. I worked with both Sarah and Corrie. They both took the time to not only teach me what to do and how to do it, but also why. I have been in physical therapy several times through the last 30+ years for back problems when I lived in other places. However, I learned things from them that I had never learned anywhere else. I think that a better understanding of the problem and what is causing the pain may help me in the future also."
"I was reluctant at first when I was told I needed to go for therapy. After my first visit my attitude completely changed. I met a wonderful therapist
and left there thinking how glad I was to have
come. She explained what had happened with my legs and how the therapy would help which it definitely did. Thank you Sarah Gunter for taking the time to educate me about lymphedema. I enjoyed my time with you my friend!  I can truthfully say I am very pleased my doctor sent me for therapy at Benchmark."
Sarah V was my OT and she is amazing! She has a heart for her patients and she will personalize your therapy to get you the best results. She is very knowledgeable and compassionate. Lauren and Sam were students and they were also very attentive and helpful in my therapy as well.
The staff is very friendly and informative. Sara Gay helped me meet my goals and answered every question I asked. I would recommend this place to everyone who‚Äôs looking for therapy after surgery ...
Everyone is amazing!They are very sweet and helpful!I love them all!They care about everyone's well being!They treat you like your someone special!May God richly bless them and their family always!
"I've been to the one in Dahlonega, and the one in Gainesville
They both are very good at their Therapy. I feel a lot better"
"Sarah was my therapist and is a knowledgable and consumate professional. While there is an atmosphere of quality care, there is also a kindness and concern that is expressed by all of the staff. I recommend them highly."
Thank you so much for helping me with my back pain-great therapy that helped! I am back to normal and I cannot thank Kori enough! The staff were all so nice and friendly.
"Benchmark Physical Therapy Sherwood is wonderful!  All of the staff, from the front desk to the PTs, are so friendly and helpful, and very accommodating when it came to scheduling my appointments.  I had a long recovery from knee surgery, but Corrie and Dan helped me get back on track to doing almost everything I could before my surgery.  Walking in for each appointment was like walking into Cheers, where everybody knows your name!  Going to therapy was hard work, however it also felt like going to visit with friends.  Thanks Benchmark Sherwood for the best PT experience I could have hoped for!  I highly recommend this location to anyone!"
"Sarah, Patrick, and Maria are absolutely wonderful! Maria heard my need to have my appointments later in the afternoon and scheduled me with Sarah and Patrick. All three have made a such a change in how I feel since my car accident. I learned quite a bit that will help me going forward with my treatment. Not only that they are all so fun to be with after a long day of work. :)
Thank you all so much!"
"Physical therapist ""Dan"" is excellent on working with patients with back issues.  No wasted time because he and his staff always kept me busy working out the whole time.  Benchmark was excellent letting me change appointment time if an issue come up for me.  When my therapy visits were over I left with a 3 page document of therapy I can do at home."
"I came to BenchMark in Gainesville, Ga with plantar faciatis, which was very painful in my right heel.
Everyone there is so friendly, helpful and just plain  nice!
Dan was my main therapist and Patrick and Sam backed him up. The plan was to get me back to walking, running and exercise classes at the YMCA, which was my goal. Dan helped me reach it. He answered all my questions, encouraged me and sent me home with ongoing exercises to help me maintain my success. Chris Bailey"
"Everyone at Benchmark Gainesville Ga are friendly.  I felt very cared for.  I got relief because my therapist made a plan specifically for me.  I recommend anyone who needs physical therapy to see the folks at Benchmark.  I am happy to be finished, but a little sad that I will not be seeing them again."
Benchmark has been great working with my schedules and listening to me.  Huge thanks to Donna & Brooke at OT.
"Great people, great atmosphere. Helped me a ton!!!!"
"Corrie, Robbi, Patrick and Maria(I know I spelled her name wrong) are all wonderful. They take the time to explain treatment and really work on the physical problem. They are very knowledgeable and empathetic and encouraging  to my therapy for my  Lymphodema."
Go 3 times a week and get beat up and I love it.  Great people and helping me make progress
"Great place, excellent therapists, and you always leave feeling better."
"(Translated by Google) I want to thank in advance to congratulate the entire team for their good work, and for my part I recommend benchmark physical therapy

(Original)
De ante mano quiero agradecer felicitar  A todo el equipo por su buen trabajo yo de mi parte recomiendo a benchmark physical therapy"




Very knowledgeable and competent care!  I highly recommend them!
The receptionist Christina is a racist and has a very unpleasant attitude.

"I had 4 sessions at PT Solutions, Powder Springs, GA. It was the worst experience I ever had at a physical therapy place. I never got full attention, and that happened during every session regardless if the place was busy or not. I had 2 therapists in 4 sessions Brandi and Princess without any prior notification. Changing therapist was very inconvenient.

Each session, the therapist gives me a useless exercise (an exercise that does not need any therapist at all) then walk away and work with three other clients at the same time. Alarm goes off after each exercise and there is no therapist around, most of the session time goes in waiting. I had to wait after the alarm went off until the therapist finally shows up, or most likely the therapist across the room will send instructions with someone else, which can be another therapist who doesn‚Äôt know my medical condition or a receptionist who is not a licensed therapist. Extremely unprofessional and disrespectful. I had a surgery in my foot, I can‚Äôt walk without crutches and a walking boot. I can‚Äôt just let whoever touch my injured foot. At the end, the therapist comes with a pack of ice for 3 minutes and let me go 10-15 minutes before the hour is over. When I requested to finish the whole hour, the response was you can stay here in ice.

I decided that this is going to be my last session at that location (or any PT solution all together) when they sent the new cleaning employee to give me an exercise direction and put ice pack around my injured foot. Poor guy didn‚Äôt even know what to do, or which part I needed the therapy for. He didn‚Äôt know how to put it, the ice pack didn‚Äôt hold together and kept falling off. That happened while the place was not busy; therapists were just chatting with each other and sent the cleaning guy to me. They saw that he can‚Äôt manage and didn‚Äôt do anything.

That place doesn‚Äôt have qualified therapist to treat a condition like mine. They had no clue what to do at all. They have bunch of other clients with much less complicated conditions. For as much as physical therapy costs, clients deserve one-on-one attention from a professional therapist with a projective recovering plan, not randomly selected exercises. I wasted my time and money without any improvement. I would never go back to that place nor recommend it to anyone."
"Princess, Brandi, Katie, Jaycee, Hannah, and Kathleen run this clinic with care and attention to detail. I was at a previous clinic before moving here and can say nothing but positive things. The clinic gets busy at times but they always pay attention to each patient to make sure they have what they need. Thank you all for you hard work and dedicated effort. I‚Äôm stronger today than I have been due to your care."
"I have been doing physical therapy at PT Solutions in Powder Springs for almost 3 months now and have so enjoyed my experience there so far!! I am always impressed with the staff, they know and acknowledge every client by name and I genuinely look forward to spending time with them. Even if they're having a busy afternoon, I always feel attended to. No matter which therapist I work with, they are equally skilled and knowledgeable in their profession and it has been very interesting learning which muscles they are targeting during the exercises. Every exercise they have you do, no matter how simple it may seem, is intentional in connecting your neuro to your muscular properly so that you learn how to move right, build muscles right, heal your current ailment and prevent future injury. It's been so fascinating learning about the intricacies in the plans of these awesome physical therapists, you just don't get that doing exercises at home by yourself- these guys are the experts for a reason. I would recommend PT Solutions in Powder Springs to anyone and am so thankful for them as they help me heal!"
"My Orthopedist prescribed physical therapy for a rotator-cuff injury. I chose PT Solutions of Powder Springs for treatment. After the first  few sessions my shoulder was restored to full mobility. I continued the sessions adding strength to my shoulder. I also was given resistance bands and exercises to perform at home between sessions at the clinic. In spite of now having full use of my shoulder, pain persisted. An MRI showed a partial tear. I was given a cortisone shot to treat the pain and advised that, having rejected surgery, I would need to continue the exercises. Months later, I am still pain free while continuing  the home exercises PT Solutions advised. I feel I owe much of my success to the caring and competent staff at PT solutions."
"My daughter tore her acl and is receiving superb care.  We did not know what to expect coming into this process but we have really enjoyed seeing her make progress from week to week.  The staff is amazing and while she isn't seen by one therapist only, she has a whole team.  They all know her name and know my husband and I.   They know what she did last and picks up from there.  They are super reassuring to her when she lacks confidence and senses her hesitation in a new drill.   They assure her that her knee will not fail her and when she finishes the drill she was scared to do, they cheer her on.  They know all of their patients and work collaboratively to ensure every one's success and healing."
I went into cardiac arrest three times and was in the ICU for one week. I was also in the hospital for about three weeks so my ability to walk among other things we‚Äôre slow and laminate. I have been going to PT solutions for two weeks now and seeing all the smiley faces encourages me to keep pushing and trying. I don‚Äôt feel like I am a number because when I walk through the door everyone say good morning Ms. Williams and asked me how was my day and allow me to express how it was regardless if it was good or bad. The staff there keeps me in courage to keep going and take another step.
"PT Solutions - Powder Springs is absolutely exceptional! The staff is friendly, courteous and professional. They keep the space extremely clean while following Covid-19 guidelines.

Brandy is a great therapist and personable. She may push you to your limits but it is all for the reason you are there. She will make certain you reach your goal!

Thanks to every one at this facility for putting up with me after my surgery. ;)  I would not be where I am today without each of you! You ALL are the best and are more appreciated than you will ever know!"
"When you walk in, all the workers great you and ask how your day is. They treat you like family and make sure you‚Äôre always comfortable with the work they put you through. I‚Äôve been coming for 4-5 months and I have felt much improvement in my knee."
Very caring therapists. I expected my pain to slowly relieve itself and it‚Äôs going as planned. I‚Äôm always working up a good sweat as well and I see it as a bonus. Highly recommended!
"There are so many great things about
PT Solutions that I had to leave a review!
So far, I have had 12 progressive sessions there!!
I am so appreciative of all the dedicated Staff at the Powder Springs location! I've had a dynamic and memorable experience working with Brandi, Katie, Princess and Jacey, along with other therapy assistants.
I'm truly thankful for all that they have showed me I can do to become stronger and eventually pain free.

They are all so professional, work as a team and put their personal care into each recovery journey. If there is anything you need, want or have questions about during or after your visits, don't hesitate to ask Kathleen. She's very knowledgeable! There's also fun things like the themed trivia and a tell your therapist questions board to engage you during the visit. Another fantastic thing is the office and equipment is constantly getting sanitized.
Also staff and patients adhere to the CDC Guidelines and Regulations. So you are in a safe environment while getting treatment.

I recommend PT Solutions Physical Therapy to any and everyone in search of a facility that is actually dedicated to your full recovery and cares about how you are doing inside and out!"
"This is one of those rare times that I wish I could give six stars. The staff is everything you could ask for on your road recovery. Kathleen's energy and positivity is infectious, and she remembers everything. I've never seen anyone arrive or leave in with a bad attitude. Brandi and Princess have all the PT knowledge that you could need. They are intelligent and know when to push or give a break. They give you traditional exercises or creative tasks that help speed your recovery. Finally, the facility is constantly being cleaned which is great during the pandemic. If you're within 30 minutes of the Powder Springs area, it is well worth your time to get to know the staff here and get some therapy in the process."
"My mom has been going to PT Solutions for 4 weeks now.  The entire staff is caring, friendly and professional.  They know each patient and always greets everyone with a smile.  Brandi is the Therapist that has been working with my Mom.  She cares about her progress and is serious about what she does and is there to help her patients.  She did a thorough evaluation of my mom to get an understanding of what makes her better or worse and to learn her specific strengths or weaknesses. She created an individualized plan to address her specific needs and my mom has already seen improvement.  Brandi addresses my mom's issues and modifies her treatments to meet her tolerance. Thank you for helping my mom on her journey to getting her quality of life back!"
"The DPT (Doctor of Physical Therapy) that has been treating me for sciatic nerve pain is remarkable. Not only is she highly skilled and knowledgeable, she genuinely cares about my well-being, explains what we are doing and how that benefits my healing and is very compassionate. All of the PTs are Doctor‚Äôs at this facility. I‚Äôm SOOO GLAD I FOUND THEM!! THEIR THE BEST PT EXPERIENCE I‚ÄôVE EVER HAD!!!"
"In my opinion, this is going to be the best therapy spot you pick. Not only because they are serious about helping you get better but also because it‚Äôs a family in that building. Everyone is there to help you get better all you have to do is set up a appointment and show up! Good head and pop out at Pt solutions on powder springs for better health careüíØ"
I absolutely look forward to coming here all the ladies are wonderful especially Brandi and princess
I broke my ankle missing the last 3 steps in March. I had my first session last week. Shortly after they called to confirm my insurance approved me for 12 weeks and today is my second session. They massaged my ankles and calves to get the muscles going. Anyhow they are awesome. Cant wait for next session. Amazing. PRINCESS CRISTEN KATHLEEN BRANDI are very helpful throughout my fears. Thanks
They are a excellent facility to go have rehab in 100
I‚Äôm so in love with the staff. Their welcoming spirit energizes me every time I walk in. Often friendly and concerning towards everybody. The staff is just over the top amazing and friendly at all times.
"From the customer service to the quality of care, this staff is top notch! I rarely complete reviews, but it was worth for this crew. If you are in need of physical therapy, they will exceed your expectations!"
The staff here are so friendly and welcoming! Highly recommend!
"The staff is very professional and always helpful and friendly.  This includes the Physical Therapists, assistants, and front desk personnel. They are concerned about your progress,  and work towards your specific goals. Everyone knows each patient and it‚Äôs a welcoming environment."
I appreciate all the help that I have received here. Each week I get better and better and I‚Äôm glad that I was referred to this facility. The therapist are nice  and motivates you to do your best.
Great friendly people. Very professional and willing to answer any questions you may have about your PT or paper work. They truly care about there patients and the qaulity of therapy they provide.
"i was treated with respect and patience when it came me doing the task.
Also the faculties were clean"
I enjoy going to PT in Powder Springs. They are very nice and attentive. They do not repeat the same exact therapy each time but work the same muscles in different ways. This keeps it interesting and not boring. I‚Äôm happy.
The staff here is truly remarkable and great people! They look out for their patients and wants nothing but what‚Äôs best for you. EXTREMELY clean place. I highly recommend physical therapy here!
"Went to PT Solutions for treatment after an ACL and meniscus surgery. I‚Äôm amazed at how caring and well mannered everyone here is, I have already recommended them to my friends with injuries.You will receive the best care here with this amazing staff !!"

"Everyone is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. They are willing to answer all my questions. I always leave Therapy encouraged, I have made tremendous improvements because of their efforts."
"I recently completed physical therapy at P T Solutions in Powder Springs.
It was truly a great experience! They worked hard to keep track of how I was progressing and feeling during my workouts. When I experienced difficulty in doing one task because of pain they tried alternate ways to accomplish the same task. As a result of my therapy I have had better than expected results.They truly work as a team and for their hard work I say ""Thank You!!""."
Awesom Staff and they make the recovery process faster!
I have had two sessions here and I love it.

Great facility and great staff! Always very welcoming and make therapy a fun time.
"The Ladies at PT Solutions: New Macland are awesome! The atmosphere is friendly & welcoming. Everyone is always professional & personable. Brandy & Princess have anointed hands. Over the past 7 yrs, I‚Äôve received a good bit of PT from various facilities. Thus far, this location has been the most effective."
"I love this team always very friendly and  professional. Even when I‚Äôm hurting and not feeling like I want to do exercises they encourage me. Princess, Kathleen,Brandi and Chris are the best.!!!!!!"
Very professional and personable with patients. I‚Äôve genuinely enjoyed my time here. Would recommend to anyone.
The facility is nice and clean. The therapist are very respectful and friendly!
"They are so friendly and listen to your needs. They are very professional yet make you feel so welcome.
So lucky they are in my area."
Love the staff. Very personable and know me by name. I always feel welcome as if I am entering their home. Thank you for everything!
Excellent services. Staff very friendly and patient. Therapists very knowledgeable and they explained the exercises or techniques very well in layman vocabulary. Have recommended pt solutions to others.
"I broke my tibia and needed Physical therapy in order to recover to my normal state. I had filled out a request form online and was contacted back by Kathleen within 10 minutes! Ten tiny minutes! How amazing is that. When I arrived I was mind blown with the warm welcoming energy. Immediately my anxiety went out the door. Both PT Brandy and Princess have worked on my left knee. I was kinda skeptical about my recovery time due to this injury being my first bone break. I attend physical therapy three times a week and I immediately saw a difference in my leg motion in two weeks. I really love both PT they have helped me so much. To top that off I am so very grateful for the flexible schedule they offer. I work long busy hours and they always fit me in. I cannot thank them enough for helping my body recover. If you are looking for a PT, Powder springs location is the place to go! You will not regret it. If I could I would give it 10 stars.

P.s. KRISTIN keeps this place spotless. Very clean no complaints."
"Great group of people! The whole staff is all smiles, they make the recovery / rehabilitation  process really fun. If i could Give them a 6th star i totally would! :)"
"The staff are amazing! Even when they are busy, they always make sure each patient is taken care of and that someone is directing them on their next exercise. I've done lots of PT elsewhere and if I had to do it again, I would come back here."
"The staff at this PT Solutions is incredible! They're super caring and have helped me so much - highly recommend coming here! Shout out to Princess, Brandi, Kathleen, & Cristen!"
This is the best placeto do physical therapy. I won't go anywhere else. The exercises are practical and you grt results! And I love Princess and her crew.
"Unbelievable staff,Very experience and professional. VERY CLEAN facility!!!!"
PT solutions is a great place to have therapy. The staff are really nice and professional and very helpful and they are very attendnative to your needs and concerns.
"This place is great, they really take care of you and get to know you more as a person than a patient. Highly recommend!"
"I‚Äôve been coming here for a while now & everytime i come, i have an amazing experience. i love everyone here they are so nice and helpful !"
They  have been  outstanding.  I have felt that they  really care  about my wellbeing.  I am so pleased with my results. I hate to stop coming but my time is up.
This is one of the best facilities I've been to they treat my daughter and myself like we are family we have much love for everyone at this location
This place is great and everyone that works here is always nice. They also helped me recover alot faster.
Great experience here at pt solutions in powder springs i have had great improvement throughout my experience definitely recommend this place
People were very nice and caring and provided the best experience due to my condition when it came to treatment
GREAT PLACE WITH A GREAT WELCOMING STAFF! LOVED EVERY EXPERIENCE IVE HAD!
"This place has been like family. They've taken great care of me, having a lot of flexible appt times and working me in when I had a schedulung conflict. Can't say enough about both the facility and the staff!"
All the ladies that work here are fantastic! Love PT Solutions of Powder Springs!
"They have an outstanding staff , and just overall amazing ."
They r good and cool
Professional and friendly staff with great team work.
Everyone is very friendly!!!






















The staff is very attentive to each patient. They keep it fun which makes for a great rehabilitation experience. It is the nicest PT facility I have seen and it is kept very clean.
"All other reviews seem to be great and that was the reason for me choosing this location as well. Unfortunately,I find it extremely difficult to get someone on the phone at this therapy place. Feel it's a little unresponsive, especially for people who are limited with the ease of movement due to an injury, being able to get a hold of someone during their regular business hours is very important - hope this is attended to. This is not a negative review,just a hint to make the place even better with their services."
"I had a bad accident on my bike resulting in osteonecrosis of my left scaphoid. It left me with great difficulties using my left hand. After several sessions at ATI I‚Äôm back to near complete functional status. Overall the experience was professional, pleasant and my exercises were always customized for my specific case. I would highly recommend to all those looking for physical therapy!"
"After an extensive injury I needed a place to help me in my next steps of recovery, learning how to walk again after spending two months in a wheelchair. While searching for PT place I did not want a cattle factory feeling, I didn't want to be just an appointment, I did not want a disount care, I didn't want to be rushed through my care, I wanted a knowledgeable PT, and I wanted advanced and forward leaning treatment; Mr.Nabil satisfied all of these requirements plus some. Mr.Nabil is one of the most knowledgeable, understanding, and kind physicians that I have ever met. His understanding of the body mechanics and how to bring them back to function is second to none, absolutely THE BEST! Besides the AMAZING care that Mr.Nabil delivers, Ms.Amber, the support specialist at the clinic, makes the world of difference with her assistance during the exercises and in helping to coordinate the care and appointments (even with my ever so demanding schedule). She is always a ray of sunshine and joy of the place, she lights up the place! I drive past at least 6 different PT places (including another ATI location) to go to Mr.Nabil's clinic but it's well worth the longer drive. This place is what medical treatment used to be at most places, carrying and meaningful, this place still has it! Don't think twice about it, book your appointment with Nabil & Amber and experience a different kind of care!"
"My daughter, who is an USAG gymnast, this past year was impacted by sever‚Äôs disease. I reached out to Nabil directly, and he was able to guide me on the appropriate next steps my daughter needed to take to recover. Although I haven‚Äôt been to the new ATI location, Nabil went above and beyond to help my daughter personally with his knowledge and guidance. He was able to breakdown all the medical terminology and proper treatment, which can be overwhelming for parents, but he was able to put my mind at ease. Thank you Nabil for your professionalism and for constantly checking up on my daughters recovery. Thanks!"
I‚Äôve tried physical therapy before and ALL they did was have me exercise. This has been a much better experience since there are doing more than just exercises. The friendly banter amongst the staff is also entertaining. It‚Äôs always a good thing to be around people who are smiling!
Best Physiotherapy ever. I‚Äôve gone to pt all over the country and never had better treatment. Nabil is a great diagnostician. Always explains everything clearly. Love this place.
Going to ATI for Therapy is the best investment you can make . Nabil is a great therapist that made me feel comfortable and easy to talk about my injury. He helped me recover from a long term injury I had in just 4 sessions. 10/10 recommend ATI for anyone!
My experience at ATI Milton was great! Very personal staff and great rehabilitation and treatment! Would definitely recommend!
"I couldn‚Äôt say enough good things about the most awesome physical therapist, Nabil Motlagh. He is SO good that I followed him to his new practice, ATI, which is located on highway 9 between Windward & McFarland.

I‚Äôve been going to him since right before my neck surgery and I can‚Äôt thank him enough. I don‚Äôt think I could have returned to teaching dance as soon as I did without him. He is caring, patient, and takes time for all his clients. (Much different than some I‚Äôve seen in the past) I also appreciate the extensive knowledge he has on athletes & dancers and what is best to get them back to their craft.

If you‚Äôre looking for a great PT, whether it is for you, your friend, or a loved one, give his office a call! You won‚Äôt regret it! üí™üèº"
"In the short time that I have been with Nabil at ATI I have seen a lot of improvement and been very impressed with my experience. Coming in, I had very low expectations on my recovery time and Nabil has been devoted to getting me back to normal activity in a timely manner. Everyone in the clinic is very nice and I have loved my time in therapy with them!"
my first time I receive physical therapy and I thank God that I have met people like Mr. Nabil and Ms. Amber are very kind and expert people in what they do my most sincere congratulations and I am that they are all going to recover from their lessons as I recovered thank you so much You are very good.
Nabil is the best physical therapist I have ever had! He takes the time to know his patients and understand what they can and can‚Äôt do.
Dr. Motlagh took great care of my elderly grandmother and provided her with home exercises for rehab snd overall conditioning. Highly recommended and trust his expertise!
Nabil is great! Highly recommend if you‚Äôre needing PT
"While I have not been to ATI for PT, I have previously had numerous PT sessions with Nabil Motlagh, the clinic director at ATI. Nabil helped me to recover from knee surgery at a surprisingly fast rate. He closely monitored the quality of my exercises to ensure that I received the most benefit and continually accessed my progress. He worked with my doctor to make sure that my recovery was done at a pace that did not exceed what was recommended. If Nabil felt that I was ready to advance my workouts, he would communicate that with my doctor and always had a new exercise plan ready when the time came. My faster-than-expected recovery is a testament to Nabil's professionalism and his ability to motivate. Hopefully I will never need PT again but if you do, I highly recommend Nabil."
Great place with great staff!!!
Few physical therapists have the knowledge that Nabil possesses. He is skillful in his practice and attends to all questions and concerns. He will work with you in accomplishing your rehab goals. I have been dealing with chronic hip pain for years now and Nabil has far exceeded my expectations. I can't recommend him enough.
"ATI restored my faith in medical professionals. I will never see any other physical therapists. They are the best, period."


"I'm so happy with the treatments I received from the staff at Benchmark Physical Therapy. I have better movement in my left hand than before. The staff makes you feel so comfortable, like family. Thank you soo much to the staff at Benchmark Physical Therapy."
"I LOVE Benchmark!  The Physical Therapists here are caring, and will work with you after an injury...with compassion!  They helped me recover from a car wreck, and it has been a miracle and blessing to feel my improvement day by day.  These Physical Therapists are at the top of their game, and treat me with care and dignity, as professionals, who helped me get my life back.  Benchmark...is the BEST IN MACON GEORGIA!"
"The entire staff were friendly and sincere. I‚Äôve had two separate rounds of physical therapy with them, pro-op and post-op. They are empathetic, warm, and inviting. I love these people and will use them for all my physical therapy needs!"
I been comin here fur bout three or four weeks Mrs Marciet is good lady but she makes me holla. I think she needs raise.... Thx Da ol goat
"I‚Äôve been coming to benchmark for 3 weeks now and I absolutely love the staff. The physical therapist is so knowledgeable, friendly, client focused. She‚Äôs is hands on. Great job"
The staff was very friendly and professional. Communications was excellent. They were willing to push me to progress. The facilities are well kept. I highly recommend them to anyone who needs physical therapy. Thank you Benchmark for being there.
Knowledgeable and professional staff with plenty of support and attention in a friendly atmosphere. I was welcomed and addressed by name from the first day I arrived for treatment and felt valued as a patient until my final day. My rating is A+++
Excellent staff.
"I'm so thankful to those that recommended BenchMark for physical therapy after my shoulder surgery.  They are wonderful.  The entire staff is friendly and courteous.  The therapists really know their job and do it well.  Yes, therapy often hurts...but I always feel better when I leave than when I arrived!  Thanks BenchMark...you're the BEST!"
"Because of my profession as an English teacher, I was experiencing neck and shoulder pain from grading countless numbers of essays. I was referred for physical therapy and selected BenchMark. The staff worked with me to get appointments that fit my schedule and were extremely professional, but also very friendly. Charlie is absolutely incredible as a therapist and as an individual. He listens, is willing to try new procedures, and is hilarious to talk to every session. My pain improved so much I was able to stop my physical therapy -- always your ultimate goal. I highly recommend BenchMark Physical Therapy."
Great clinic and staff at this clinic. All the therapists and staff showed they genuinely care about your condition and progress. Also had a very good balance between exercises and manual therapy with my PT. Overall a great experience and would highly recommend.
Great staff that were extremely caring and invested in my recovery and rehabilitation. The entire staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Charlie was especially very patient and went above and beyond to help me with my recovery
"Phenominal staff; extremely knowledgeable and very professional. I had just had pretty severe shoulder surgery, due to action sports incidents, and Charlie&team helped me aquire back my total range of motion and strength, I could not be more satisfied. The program he laid was perfect, and very successful. I doubt I‚Äôll ever go anywhere else.....period!"
Helpful staff and great facility. Dr. Dwozan is top notch! I would highly recommend.
My bill for the therapy ended up being between $300-$500 per visit and all they did was what a personal trainer would do.  I did exercises and they told me if my form was good.  I received about 10 minutes per visit of actual therapy and that was about it.  I would not recommend their services.
"Not good continuity of care. Lack of good communication from therapist to patient. Therapists spent more time socializing-communicating with each other than explaining and helping their patients. Several times given very fast exercise instructions, (not a good practice for patients that have been significantly sleep deprived due to pain)then left alone while PTs socialized. Had to interrupt these conversations so I could ask questions. Like I am in pain, do I need to reach to the point it causes pain? This was frustrating and awkward, and the delay in assistance caused me unnecessary pain.  When passed on to a PT in training, there was no introduction made by the primary PT to the patient and PT in training. Also no name tag on PT in training. While there, on a new day of week, I did notice a male PT that was being professional by being focused only  on his patients (and not socializing with other PTs)and assisting and communicating  appropriately to his patients."
Everyone there is very personable and friendly. I‚Äôm thankful for everyone there who helped me along the way of my injuries.
"The folks are very efficient, respectful, and friendly. While the atmosphere is congenial, they work you pretty hard - which is what you pay for. I recommend Pro Therapy at Demorest without any reservation."



"As a referring doctor ( chiropractor ), I've been working with them for nearly 3 years now.  Wonderful experience from top to bottom!  Highly recommend!"
"I have been going to Neurosport Physical Therapy for close to 3 months following surgery due to a sports injury.  Their staff creates a great environment to rehab and bring a lot of experience to the process.  I have found that each time I go in for an appointment, they have new exercises for me to continue developing my rehab.  I would recommend!"
"Claire and Nolan at the Windward location are AMAZING!
I have a plateau tibia fracture with a bone graph that happened in July.  After waiting 10 non weight bearing, October,  I started with another PT program.  My progress was slow and painful.  After going to them for 2 months 3 times a week, I saw little or no progress.

At the end of November I started with Neurosport.  What a GREAT experience.  I had instant relief of pain, more flexibility, and my frustration level dropped immediately.  They are always ready for me and willing to listen and try new treatments and exercises with each visit.   Claire and Nolan always gauge my progress, assess what is needed and it is
ALWAYS CORRECT.   I highly recommend the Neurosport."
Very professional and friendly staff


"I have been going to PT Solutions at Jonquil Plaza in Smyrna for various ailments for a couple of years. From the very first day I walked in, the staff has been friendly, helpful, interested, and committed to helping me recover from whatever surgery or injury, I had, as well as to find relief from a chronic back problem. I have spent most of my time being treated by Dallas, the location manager, however, I have also been treated by Brendon and Jamie at one time or another. The three of them are absolute professionals when it comes to understanding what is causing my pain and how best to treat it. While they do work me as hard as I can handle, the whole staff also makes it fun to be there. I have always been told that by the end of the session, they wanted me to have dramatically less pan than when I came in that day. Monique, the office manager at the front desk, is very professional, helpful, and accommodating whenever I am trying to set up the appointment days and times for my treatment, or to answer any billing questions.
I wholeheartedly recommend PT Solutions at Jonquil Plaza in Smyrna if you are recovering from a surgery or injury, or just have chronic pain. They WILL help you get better. I give them 5 stars without hesitation"
"I was blown away by my experience at PT Solutions. I started out skeptical, as I had previously tried physical therapy with a different group and had not enjoyed my experience. But PT Solutions was absolutely amazing.  Everybody there is incredibly friendly, always greeting me by name. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly.  Brandon was my physical therapist and he was funny, always listened to me, and was genuinely interested in helping me get better. And the best part of it all was that I am now free of pain, something I haven't been able to say for a LONG time.  Thank you Brandon and thank you PT Solutions team!"
"PT Solutions of Jonquil and the therapists (Jaimi, Dallas, Brandon) were a game changer for my husband!! They were able to diagnose his condition and get him back to himself!

Every appointment, we were greeted and treated with kindness always feeling known and seen. The staff were all really attentive and seemed to truly care about us.

Cannot recommend this location and the therapists here enough. If ever we have physical therapy needs in the future we're calling for Jaimi!"
"I am working with Jaimi Patel at PT Solutions, and I am extremely happy with the progress I'm making. Rehabbing from a ruptured achilles, I am 6 weeks post op and am already walking without crutches and a boot. Everyone at PT Solutions Jonquil has a positive attitude, they're very welcoming, and the atmosphere is great for all patients recovering from traumatic injury. I highly recommend this PT clinic!"
Everyone at PT Solutions Jonquil are amazing! From the moment you enter the door you are always greeted by every staff member. Jaimi was my therapist and she was GREAT! Very friendly environment! I would highly recommend to come here for physical therapy!
"Jaimi Patel rocks!
My hamstrings work again üòÄüëçüá∫üá∏"
"The staff at PT Solutions of Jonquil are kind, understanding, and knowledgeable. Jaimi, Dallas, Rebekah, and the rest of the team identified what was causing my years-long upper-back pain, worked with me to improve my range of motion and posture, and gave me the ongoing tools to persist in assuaging my pain. I showed much improvement over the few months I was a patient, and I fully recommend their services to those seeking counsel and assistance with any myriad of aches they might have the misfortune of enduring."
"They brought me back to full functionality with all of their sessions. The staff there make you feel like family , it‚Äôs a lot of hard work but it‚Äôs worth it !"
"The therapists at this location are amazing, especially Dallas! And the staff is welcoming and friendly. It's just a really comfortable environment for getting well. Highly recommend!"
"I love the friendliness and knowledge of Dallas Roberts, and I highly recommend her professional skills. She will put you at ease and make you feel better all at the same time."
They are so friendly at the same time they are very professional. I‚Äôve been to other physical therapists but was never able to get any relief for my pain   However the staff at PT Solutions was able to pinpoint the cause of my discomfort immediately and used light pressure in order to gain mobility so I could then do the helpful exercises.   I would highly recommend PT Solutions for anyone having problems with mobility    They are easy to find in the Jonquil Center in the same parking lot as Publix. They are also in the Wellstar system. Try them out you‚Äôll be very happy you did. Lorraine
"PT Solutions of Jonquil is awesome-  knowledgeable and caring therapists (Dallas and Jaime), sweet and personable staff (Madison and Muna), and a  lovely facility. I highly recommend it!"
"This facility is great.  Clean, roomy and bright.  More importantly the therapist and support staff are knowledgeable,  care about your health and recovery and extremely personable."
"I‚Äôve hurt my back through working out and I can confidently say these physical therapists have done wonders for me! The front desk is the kindest, the therapists are the sweetest, and overall this therapy office is the best in the city!"
"The therapists are friendly and knowledgeable. They are gentle and compassionate. The facility is great also, vey up to date equipment."
"Early last year my wife startedtraining for a weightlifting competition and was involved in an accident that could‚Äôve killled her. She sustained several injuries, was hospitalized and had surgery but was very depressed. She spent a year with PT Solutions where their care and Erin‚Äôs awesomeness contributed to her condition today, with mobility and a lot of meditation she‚Äôs back to fighting weight üí™üèΩ I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful üôèüèΩ"
"I can‚Äôt stop bragging about this PT Solutions! I‚Äôm a weightlifting coach. I was involved in a car accident resulting in several injuries including a torn labrum. I worked with the facility for about a year. PT soulutions helped me bounce back sooner than expected. 8 months post op and I‚Äôm already closing in on prior maxes.The therapist are very knowable and commited to helping their patients reach their PT goals. I highly recommend this place!! Thank you, Erin and Dallas!! :)"
"Very clean,friendly environment, expert physical therapist. I will recommend to my friends."
Dallas is a GREAT therapist along with the PAs that assist her. She knows ALL the pressure points to push on. Lol
"Dallas is always intelligent, kind and professional. Couldn't ask for a better PT:)"












"Karissa and her team are absolutely amazing! Our family has been going here for the past few years for different injuries. Every therapist is very knowledgeable, compassionate, and hard working. It‚Äôs such a caring and enjoyable environment to be in! Karissa and the office staff are always checking in on me. She listens to what I have to say and knows the best plan to get me back on my feet. She pushes me to do the best I can while making sure I‚Äôm not over doing it. They truly care about each and every patient and have been very accommodating to my schedule. I 100% recommend PT Solutions of Cedarcrest!"
"Sadly, I completed my physical therapy sessions today for a torn bicep and partially torn rotator cuff. I say sadly because my experience with my therapist, Caroline, was tremendous. Though the entire staff at this location is delightful, Caroline provided incredible therapy, and the healing process following my surgery is totally on target. She was professional, yet she was fun to talk to. She directed my recovery with just the right exercises at the appropriate intervals. I would highly recommend PT Solutions of Cedarcrest."
"This Place is a WONDERFUL place to do your Physical Therapy. They have made my rehabilitation process as easy and painless as possible. Anna is my therapist and she is TERRIFIC, she has a great personality and awesome work ethic. All their therapists and staff are awesome and terrific!!! Shoutout Anna, Karissa, Janet, Lauren, Kaitlyn, Katelyn!!! I even surprised them with a Tribute Tattoo!!!                 üíô‚ù§üíõ‚ù§üíô Love Skinny"
"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place, and their PTs.  They are the reason I am walking again- and I am so grateful. They make recovery do-able, and cheer you along the entire way. They won‚Äôt let you give up until you reach your goals. They make recovery fun!"
So grateful for Karissa and the rest of the PT solutions cedarcrest team! The staff is always kind and helpful. The location and hours are super convenient and scheduling appointments is a breeze. 10/10 recommend!
"Visited this clinic earlier this year. Everyone was super friendly and helpful in figuring out my issue and how to help.
Would highly recommend PT Solutions Cedarcrest if you need a physical therapist!"
"The team at Cedarcrest PT Solutions is fantastic.

Knowledgeable , friendly, compassionate, competent & results driven.  Team centered approach to get you back in action.  The office works with you for scheduling  your appointment times.  They have multiple tables and therapists to accommodate your busy schedule.

As a Seven Hills resident, it doesn‚Äôt get any more convenient.

Highly recommended!! Five stars!!"
"Cedarcrest is the Cedarbest!  :)

Janet has been my therapist for the past couple of months. She and the rest of the Cedarcrest team have been so great working to make injury recovery a real thing for me (lower back). Coincidently, they also have cared for my wife (shoulder) and daughter (ankle) this year. Without Janet we would be a family of broken and unwanted toys. It's clear that she truly cares about her patients in a personal way and is determined to help with the healing process.

Thanks to PT Solutions and the Cedarcrest team specifically. Special shout out to Janet for just being the best ever!"
Karissa is one of the best physical therapists that I‚Äôve had! I‚Äôve loved my experience at this location and will definitely be coming back!!
"Let me 1st say I am not a serial review writer. It takes some exceptional experience (good or bad) to prompt me to share my un-prompted opinions with the world. But in this case I don't mind making an exception. I have been to 2 separate clinics in PTS organization. I have found both to be exceptional at the care and practice of helping each of us get better. I was a patient after back surgery and frankly lost about what was next. But the moment I met Janet (my therapist) I just felt like I had met a person who listened to my fears, concerns, and my goals. She didn't promise me it would be easy. But she was there for each set-back, each step in progress, and to nudge me when I didn't really feel like putting in the work. Over the weeks of my journey I really got to know the people in this organization and appreciate them for all they do. They truly care about their patients and helping them to get better. I frankly do not know where I would be without them. I was able to work with some phenomenal people on my journey back to doing the things I love. And I know it would not have been possible without them. So Thank YOU Janet, Carissa, Stephanie, Mary, Caitlin (x2), Lauren and several more I know I am leaving out. God Bless each of you as much as you have blessed me. If you are hurt or re-habbing, AND you are willing to participate in your recovery, These are the places you want to be."
"Karissa and her team have been absolutely amazing in my care, no matter what curve or crazy injury I walk in there with. As a former athlete, I have done more than my share of PT in my lifetime and I have never enjoyed it or felt that it was more effective as it has been during my time as PT Solutions.  If you end up being there a long time like I have, these people become your friends and family. My kids even love them! It is such a caring environment, yet so fun. Everyone is always laughing, while working hard. I know that my concerns are always taken seriously and heard, Karissa has even emailed me on the weekend or after hours to check in on me after a surgery or particularly bad day. My favorite part is that even after a bad day at work, I leave in less pain (usually) and with my spirits brightened. You truly will not find a better clinic!"
"Karissa is amazing! I had postpartum hip pain for years and couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong or how to fix it. I finally decided it was time to try physical therapy and I‚Äôm so glad I ended up here. From my initial consultation I felt so comfortable with Karissa (the rest of the staff was super friendly too). She listened to everything I had to say and worked diligently with me to find the cause of my pain, then created a rehab program that was challenging but still manageable. A few months later my hip pain was finally gone and now I find myself sad that I don‚Äôt need to go back! Highly recommend PT Solutions at Cedarcrest!"
"Excellent staff, always creating an environment that allows for success in your recovery!"
I have been going to here for many years for many different injuries and have seen all the therapist that have worked here and have never had a bad experience. everyone is very nice as well as going above and beyond to help me recovery. I have recommended many of my teammates to see Karissa since she has helped me through many injuries and has helped me prevent new injuries. Thank you to everyone who works at PT solutions for helping me through the recovery process
"This Place is a WONDERFUL place to do your Physical Therapy. They have made my rehabilitation process as easy and painless as possible. Anna is my therapist and she is TERRIFIC, she has a great personality and awesome work ethic. All their therapists and staff are awesome and terrific!!! Shoutout Anna, Karissa, Janet, Lauren, Kaitlyn, Katelyn!!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ Love Skinny"
"Such a wonderful staff! Carissa, Janet, Anna, and Mary are the best physical therapists! Very professional and informative. Katelyn and Tayler are great assistants. The front desk staff are so helpful and friendly! I highly recommend this team."
"I am so impressed with the level of service and care I receive from PT Solutions in Dallas. After suffering knee pain, my therapist Janet, quickly assessed my problem, determined a course of action and started putting me through a plan that has quickly put me on the road to recovery. Just a few sessions in and I‚Äôm already back to running. Of course YMMV. But for me it has been a quick response and a positive experience. I highly recommend them."
"I love coming here. I‚Äôve been coming for over a year and they have made me part of the family. All of the therapists will welcome you with open arms, and if you‚Äôre looking to get better then this is the place to go."
"The staff at PT Solutions @ Cedarcrest is simply one of the best I've encountered! They are extremely friendly, organized, and run efficiently. I would recommend their office and my therapist, Karissa, to everyone."
"I went to see Karissa for knee pain and everyone in the facility was great! I haven‚Äôt had a better experience in another medical center. Unfortunately, due to the rates set by my insurance, I could not continue treatment. Karissa provided exercises for me to continue in my gym routine and all the information about my condition. Recommended 10/10."
"Subsequent to my knee replacement , I sought the help and expertise of this practice, I was amazed at the expertise of Janet and Anne, and also the assistants Rolland and Katelyn. The front desk staff , Lauren ,was very helpful and nice as well . I have made amazing gains with this practice.....Thanks folks !!!"
"We were recommended by our Pediatrician to take our 4 week old for an evaluation, and our ONE evaluation visit was $650- with insurance. Our deductible is $750 per person for reference.
I called and asked if we could pay the non insurance rate (which was $150-$200) for the initial evaluation, but they would not change it for us since we had insurance. What an absolute scam.
The $650 was not us continuing therapy, it was literally just one hour for a visit, for a 4-week-old. It was a total ""first time Mom"" move and we absolutely got taken advantage of.
I understand paying the deductible if you are CONTINUING treatment because clearly that makes sense, but $650 for a 40ish minute visit for a 4 week old..... I AM IN THE WRONG LINE OF WORK. Seriously, come on. That's pretty disgusting.
We left with verbal instructions on stretches to do with our child, and were told to come back once a week.....we got no written information or details about my child's ""diagnosis."" Actually, I wouldn't even call it a diagnosis because we were not told anything.
My child is 6.5 months old (and yes, I have been fighting to pay the bill since she was 4 weeks old) and she is a perfect baby, not another day of PT in her life.

So, PT Solutions, are you punishing those with insurance? So frustrating that if I didn't have insurance, I would have saved $500!!

IF you so choose to support this money hungry chain, then do not make the mistake I did. Say you do not have insurance for your first initial visit, so you do not fight the same battle I did!

You should be ashamed of yourselves, PT Solutions for ripping off and taking advantage of hard-working individuals."
"If you can love physical therapy (it hurts, but it works), this is the place to do it.  Working with Janet has been great and she is very knowledgeable and knows what I need!  So far it's been a great experience."
I was referred to PT Solutions when my youngest daughter suffered an injury from playing soccer. Karissa Tippens was absolutely fantastic throughout all of the physical therapy sessions. She was able to get my daughter back on the soccer pitch in a very timely manner - and was instrumental in her making a full recovery. I would highly recommend Karissa and PT solutions to anyone in need of a Physical Therapist!
"Absolutely amazing staff. Karissa Tippens has taken great care of two of my daughters, both of whom have suffered unusual injuries in soccer and have each required extended time to build of strength and flexibility not only to return to the game, but ongoing to prevent future issues.  Karissa and the whole staff have taken time to invest personally in the girls' recovery and have grown to feel like extended family! They truly care, and are always very honest with their evaluations and clear with instructions. Great staff, great facility!"
"Easy to schedule an appointment. Mel was helpful getting my paperwork together and very friendly. Karissa and Lauren put exercises together to help my shoulder pain. I got acupuncture type therapy as well. They gave me exercises to do at home between visits. Really enjoyed the staff, laidback and professional. You don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdoctor visit.‚Äù Highly recommend."
"PT Solutions Seven Hills is wonderful!  They work with your schedule, listen to your concerns/needs and respond!  The care and treatment are outstanding!  Highly recommend.   Big ‚ÄòThank you!‚Äô to Karissa and the whole PT Staff!"
"Our family has been coming to this PT Solutions for almost 2 years. Not because they haven't helped heal, but because of the extent of our injuries and physical therapy ordered by our physicians after various multiple surgeries. They have done an amazing job getting me from where I was unable to walk to the point I am at now. They've done amazing work helping me heal from a serious concussion with horrible cognitive limitations. They are always there when we need them. They listen to our concerns, our pains, and work within our specific abilities. I recommend them to anyone needing any level of physical therapy. I trust them with our healing."
I can‚Äôt imagine going to a different place for therapy. The staff is so helpful and kind and such a great atmosphere. I would give them more than 5 stars if I could.
"I saw Anna for an injury screening for my knee pain. She was knowledgeable, informative, and nice. She gave me a solid home exercise routine that has helped my pain tremendously. Staff was helpful and kind and atmosphere was comfortable. Recommended10/10 times."
"Karissa is a phenomenal therapist!  The staff is also professional and knowledgeable.  If you are in need of therapeutic services, do not hesitate to contact PT Solutions."
"After years of pain and treatments that did not last, I was told by my orthopedic surgeon that my only relief would be surgery. Instead, I chose physical therapy. After months of physical therapy, I am 100% pain free because of Karissa. The staff is very friendly and professional. The environment is inviting. They have all become my second family. Highly recommended."
The staff at PT Solutions Cedarcrest is all fantastic.  I have been seen three times for different things and it's been a great experience every time.  Would recommend to anyone with an injury.
"PT Solutions is the place for all your therapy needs. The atmosphere the Karissa and her staff create genuinely a great place to rehab. Rehab is emotional as well as physical and having an atmosphere where healing can take place is essential. Personally, I have rehabed at PT Solutions for three different injuries and I would go back again and again. As crazy as it may sound this is a peaceful place to rehab. Without reservations I recommend them to you."
The staff are fantastic! The docs worked collaboratively to figure out injury/ies and the best rehab plan. Have helped me being get back to pain free exercise.
"If you live on or around Cedarcrest Rd. this is where you need to do physical therapy. Karissa is terrific and the facility is top notch. I‚Äôve used PT Solutions for years, and I‚Äôm so happy to have a such a great therapist two minutes down the road."
"These people go above and beyond for me and my husband.  I was already seeing them for my shoulders, then after a recent snow event, I slipped on a patch of ice.  Ouchie!  They worked me in and did everything they could to make the pain in my back bearable two days in a row.  They are kind and compassionate and the absolute best.  I work mostly with Karissa and Jake.  But they all are great.  Highly recommend.
Thanks, Pamela Houston"
"We have been through a long journey with this team. In April 2018, we were in a severe accident which lead to the loss of our 4 year old daughter. My wife, myself and my Mother in law needed months of extensive surgeries and hospital stays. When we came out, we immediately came here. Karissa and her team cried with us, comforted us, and worked with us. You will never meet a more caring and dedicated group of people."
They always take good care of everyone. Love this place!
"I loveeeee PT solutions in general, but at Cedarcrest everytime you go in you feel like a part of their family. Karissa helped me fight to save my leg long ago and has followed me through the process. Everyone is so caring there (especially Lauren)."
"PT Solutions does a great job!  They are very caring people and always friendly!  They helped me with neck pain several years ago, and after just a couple of weeks with neck and shoulder pain again, I am seeing improvement.  I'm confident they will get me back in shape soon!"
Friendly and caring staff. Everyone goes beyond expectations with the goal of the patient in mind. I would recommend to everyone who needs superb PT.
"I love PT Solutions in Dallas, GA!!  I needed Physical Therapy after knee surgery and I could not imagine going anywhere else.  Everybody there is absolutely amazing!  The therapists and the aides are extremely supportive, super encouraging, and wonderfully caring.  I worked with Karissa and she is the absolute best!!  I had some unexpected difficulty (physically) recovering from my knee surgery but Karissa got me over the hurdles (literally and figuratively).  And while the pain caused tears, Karissa kept me smiling through it.  She encouraged me during hard times and celebrated the milestones.  She even went the extra mile assisting me in getting certain at home devices to help further my physical therapy.  I also worked with Roland (an aide) who was an awesome support as well, helping me and encouraging me along the way.  And everytime I walked through the door for my appts Lauren was there to greet me, and was always so sweet.  They are also always excited to see you which makes you feel so welcomed into their PT family.  Aside from the professionalism everyone displayed, and the caring support and encouragement they offered with every visit, it was also a fun atmosphere to be in.  And when you are recoverying from surgery, some fun laughs go a long way in keeping your spirits lifted and distracting you from pain or difficulties you encounter on the road to recovery.  I'm no longer near the Dallas location, but I don't mind, these amazing people are worth the 30+min drive.  I have to have a 2nd knee surgery (on my other knee this time) and I can't wait to return to PT Solutions in Dallas for my post-op rehab.  There is no better group of people that I would want to get me through post-op recovery and back on my feet strong!  And there's nobody I trust more than Karissa when it comes to my knees!"
Easy and flexible scheduling that worked with my busy life. They are great!
The staff is wonderful!  They listen to your concerns and explain the what and why at every step of the way!
"Great staff!  They are knowledgeable, kind, and strive to be helpful."
"Everyone there is knowledgeable, kind and caring. They are the best!"
"The staff and therapists are bar none, highly professional, and tailored the therapy for my lower back injury. The pain is relieved by the exercises, and pressure points, as well as heating pads. Progress is being made to get me back toward full recovery."
"Love it ! They have been super nice and they don't push to far but, they push  far enough!"
"AWESOME staff, friendly and professional!"
Professional clean knowledgeable
Professional & knowledgeable.
















"My visit to PT Solutions in North Augusta, SC was a very satisfying session. I felt special. Kasia Mooney was so informative. She and her assistant explained in detail every step of the session. They made me feel relaxed and very comfortable with them. I would  definitely recommend you try PT Solutions for your physical therapy need. A big shout out to the entire staff."
"I cannot say enough good things about the staff here!! Everyone from the therapists to the ladies at the front helping you with insurance and scheduling were not only friendly, but incredibly helpful and always went above and beyond to make sure that your needs were met! I moved in the middle of my therapy and chose to drive 2 hours for my appointments because I loved this office and their staff so much!"
The staff here is amazing! I came in with neck pain stemming from an accident. Kasia was able to do an initial analysis to determine what treatment I would need. I had the liberty of working with all of the therapists here and I only have good things to say. They are all great at what they do and I‚Äôd recommend PT Solutions of North Augusta to everyone. I‚Äôm very pleased with how they do business here.
"I have a history of not-so-good experiences with physical therapy, so I was nervous going in the first time for work on my elbow and shoulder. It did not take long for them to put me at ease and they have continued to earn my trust.  Kasia and Corey are knowledgeable and competent. They take time to listen, work with how you are feeling and your pain level, and continue to challenge you with a variety of methods and exercises. It's pretty incredible the progress I've made in just a few weeks. They work hard to create an environment in which you are comfortable and can do the work needed to get better, and they make PT as fun as it can be. The admin staff are fantastic, and it's been great to work with Bryce during his rotation here. I won't go anywhere else for therapy. These folks are the best!"
From the start with a Friendly welcome to a thorough review of my needs along with a detailed program for recovery made my visit a truly great experience.
"Staff was so courteous and professional and all my Nana needed was the bathroom! Highly recommend seeing them for their actual service.
10 out of 5 stars!"
"There is such a wonderful atmosphere at PT Solutions in North Augusta.   Cory, Kasha, and Sarah greet everyone by name and are engaging throughout my visit.  Cory and Kasha skillfully guide me through my recovery process and help me push through beyond what I think I can do.  They celebrate my success with me.  I am super pleased with the service they provide and also the family atmosphere.  My two year old knows them by name and is very excited the days she gets to come with and see them."
"Very professional and friendly staff! Kasia was very professional and fun to work with, she genuinely loves her job. I was there for lower back pain and left a month later back in business! Very clean and organized facility that has a GameStop and Cold Stone next door. Highly recommend."
"The facility is clean, well equipped and well organized. The staff are educated, experienced and friendly. They go out of their way to make sure you get the attention you need. In my case, due the the severity of my injuries (T10  Spinal cord injury with multiple broken bones) that meant thinking outside the box. Once your session is over for the day they are already planning on how to improve on the next step. You can set up text and email reminders so you know when your next appointment is. Thanks to everyone from the coordinators to the Therapist,  I am now living on my own and on my way to total independence."
"I can honestly say that PT Solutions is one of
the best physical therapy in Augusta Georgia.
They truly out weights all the competition that out there, to know their stuff to get you healed and gets you walking right out the door in no time. They are patience, kind and energized, only to make you feel comfortable and and like family, no matter your injury the experience is far more than you'll ever know. ‚úù

Thanks
PT Solutions"
"I recommend PT Solutions of North Augusta,SC  for several reasons.  After I was given a list of places to go for physical therapy I chose PT Solutions and I'm glad I did.   Each session starts with an evaluation of your current condition.  The staff is very professional and I'm saying that from my experience from the start of each PT session they demonstrate and explain why and what the exercises are designed to do.  Each session has progressed me into a fast recovery.  Yes, you have to do the work but, the staff works along with you during each session and you feel better each time you do the exercises.  Great place to get diagnosed after a injury.  I'm looking forward to a full recovery soon because of PT Solutions they have made a believer out of me because of this professional staff."
"I had a great experience, including a personalized care plan that focused on getting me back to what I was able to do before my injury. Had amazing results after just the second session. Thanks Kasia!"
We appreciate the careful but challenging work by very competent therapist.
Very professional and courteous service! Wonderful caring staff! I‚Äôm definitely progressing with my therapy.
"The staff has been wonderful!  I have a couple of issues, and one will require surgery.  They are taking care of the one issue, while we wait for the surgery.  Each staff member is aware of my problems and work with me, diligently, to care for both!  I highly recommend them to anyone who needs any kind of physical therapy!"
"The staff at PT Solutions in North Augusta are very friendly, explain what they are doing and helped me understand why certain exercises helped ease my pain more than others.  I am doing dry needling and Katie is wonderful!  I have a low pain threshold and she does the needling where I don't even realize she is putting the needles in.  I have been to other therapy places for various reasons and honestly never felt therapy was worth going to.  PT Solutions is by far the best place I've been and I know they are helping me!"
"PT solutions is a great place for PT. I've had PT other places, and this place is the best. They are very committed to your plan of care."
"I‚Äôve been to PT at multiple sites. Most are OK,  some are good, but this place is amazing. I was so totally and completely impressed. The personnel are so well trained and highly educated. They sorted out my problem quickly and have me well on the way to recovery!"
"Great group!! The care and individual attention is very important. Instead of being one of 4 patients per therapist n just being give an exercise for a specific time, they show sincere interest and attention with each patient."
"PT solutions has a very clean facility with friendly staff. My Physical Therapist is Kasia Konopka and she is fantastic. Every exercise she has me do she demonstrates, is very attentive to how you preform, and ensures you use the correct form. After you finish an exercise she always asks ‚ÄúWhere did you feel that?‚Äù and then discusses why she had you do the exercise for your specific ailment. I was provided an easy to follow at home workout to do which has helped accelerate my progress. Before I went to Kasia I was having trouble doing everyday tasks and after 2 weeks I am already backing off my medication and can walk without pain. I recommend PT Solutions, especially Kasia, to anyone who needs physical therapy."
Stay mobile and you'll soar into old age.
"These are knowledgable, caring people."
Staff was friendly and was helpful in treating my shoulder.
Very nice friendly peopleüòä
Great personnel and service












"I couldn‚Äôt have asked for better care and guidance to help me through my physical therapy at Benchmark Howell Mill after a herniated disc with acute sciatica. I worked with Spencer for a couple sessions then Andrew for the remaining visits. You can tell these guys love what they do and really want to help people. I would actually look forward to my time there because I knew I would be making another step towards progress, as well learning new things about my body and exercises to improve my overall well being.  The entire staff is amazing, fun and super friendly. Highly recommended!"
"I thought for sure I would need surgery, but after two weeks with Andrew and the staff I was better than ever.  I spent years in discomfort and Andrew assessed my issue, corrected my behavior, and now I‚Äôm better.  I highly recommend this location and will definitely request to return if there is ever a need.  Thank you,

Wayne"
The staff is excellent. I believe his name is Alan amazing. He understood exactly what the problem was. I would recommend this facility.
Andrew helped me with my recovery and it went quicker than a normal timeline! Recommending BenchMark Howell Mill to everyone I know!
"Had severe back/leg pain and was diagnosed with Sciatica. Bianca and Simone worked to get me scheduled in the same day I called, and within a couple of sessions with Andrew and Spencer my pain had almost totally disappeared. I appreciated the depth of knowledge that they had about the body and various exercises, as well as the personal attention they gave me to help design a go-forward plan. Thanks again guys for everything, I am feeling great."
Andrew and the team are AWWSOME!!! He helped me get back to 100% quickly and safely. Would definitely recommend.
"To the entire Howell Mill Benchmark Physical Therapy Team,

You all have done wonders for me! You all are patient and understanding, when you don‚Äôt have to be, with everyone. The teamwork, communication and care that‚Äôs displayed between not only the staff, but the patients alike, is truly awesome! Thank you for everything and keep up the great work!!

Take care,
Carl...
Out!"
They were the best. Patient and always willing to work around my schedule.
"I worked mostly with Spencer and he was great!  The vibe of the staff was positive and you can tell they like each other and what they do.  By the end, they felt more like friends than service providers.  Parking was never an issue since it's a large shopping center (and it's free).  I saw definite improvement in my mobility and strength.  Would absolutely go back there if I ever need PT again."
"This location is fantastic! I've been working with Spencer, and he really does listen to what's working and what isn't. Everyone here is thoughtful and kind!

Update - I always appreciate when others update reviews after time, and I'm going to do the same. This practice is phenomenal. They're patient, kind, and thorough. I've been through PT at another Benchmark location in the past, and while both were great, my experience at Howell Mill has been nothing but positive."
"Thank you Benchmark P.T. for helping me reach my goals. I wasn't too sure early on if it would really help, but once I started doing the ""homework"" home exercises combined with my schedule visits. I truly saw the improvement! Everyone from the check in to the therapist and even P.T.students were all so nice and helpful.  I worked with Spencer mostly,  but everyone was GREAT....Bianca, Ian, Kayla to name a few. I am sorry I can't remember everyone's names while I write this review, but they all worked as a team and from my personal experience and observation,  treat their patients with respect, and kindness. But don't forget to do your homework.!!! üòÅ"
"Your search ends here ! You won‚Äôt find a more welcoming or dedicated group of therapists elsewhere. Krysta, Spencer, and the other staff have created a unique environment of upbeat positivity. They truly care about you and want to see you succeed. I will definitely refer friends and family to this clinic."
I had the pleasure of working with Spencer for a low back injury due to a car wreck. He was AWESOME! I‚Äôm an occupational therapist for a hospital- and he did a great job at adding functional elements to our sessions. He is also really talented with dry needling! I  wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd like it but the results were great! I can‚Äôt recommend Spencer enough!
I worked with a combination of Krysta and Spencer during my time. They're both great! I will say certain appointment times you'll have several people in the office and even with the assistants/PT in training attention can be divided. Early morning gets you solo time!
"Krysta & the whole team at Benchmark physical therapy are truly one of a kind! I would highly recommend this place to anyone! After breaking my leg I never thought I would walk normally again but after working with Krysta I am walking & even running better than ever! Krysta, Spencer, Delaney, Jessica, & Chao are truly such kind hearted, hardworking, caring people & I have nothing but good things to say about all of the staff at Benchmark Physical therapy! I was very impressed with my experience!"
Krysta is the absolute BEST..... She is the only one that i will allow to do my dry needling!!! The whole staff is awesome! The vibe is great and they are overall just some good hearted ppl
I absolutely love everything about this clinic!! The atmosphere is inviting & the staff are very friendly. Everyone wants to see you succeed and will always give encouraging words. The staff truly connects with you and creates a bond. Your goal is recognized and the staff will do everything to make sure you reach your goal. You will definitely leave satisfied!!
"Benchmark Howell Mill is amazing. The entire staff was very helpful and engaging throughout my recovery. I regained more strength and mobility in my knee than I thought I could ever hope for. The atmosphere there made me look forward to each appointment- even if it meant a challenging session. While I hope to not need PT in the future, if I do, I know I'm going back here."
"I strongly recommend the Howell Mill Road BenchMark team for anyone needing or considering physical therapy. I'm a former collegiate and professional athlete (basketball) and underwent a unique foot surgery. After being immobilized for 2 months in a cast and 2.5 months in a walking boot, I suffered from severe muscle atrophy and could barely walk on my own during my first visit. I was frustrated and almost depressed due to thinking I would never be able to resume my normal level of activity again. Jessica was my primary physical therapist and literally got me up and running again. It was not easy and required a lot of work on my own as well as what I was shown during my sessions, but it was well worth it in the end. Jessica, Krysta, Laura, & Bianca are who I primarily worked with and they are amazing. They work you hard, encourage you, and make you laugh while never losing sight of your goals and progression. I would return to them in a heartbeat if I ever need PT in the future. Also Cheo runs the front desk and is the bomb when it comes to rescheduling, updating you to any insurance or other issues, and makes sure you're well taken care in a timely matter. The Howell Mill BenchMark team became  like family to me during my recovery process, and I know they'll do the same for you! Thanks guys!"
"Jessica and her team are fantastic! I regained more strength and mobility in my ankle than I thought I could ever hope for. Everyone at Benchmark Howell Mill is friendly and very good at what they do! The atmosphere there made me look forward to each appointment- even if it did mean plenty of hard work towards recovery. While I hope to not need PT in the future, if I do, I know I'm going back here.

EDIT: Fair warning- expect to get a bill almost a year later for a balance you had no idea you owed and being told it's over 90 days late. It could be your insurance's fault, but good luck with customer service..."
"Everyone at Benchmark Howell Mill is amazing! Not only do they care about your rehab, they also want to see you return to your full self. The therapists and staff are all so kind. Being here has made the road to recovery smooth and enjoyable. I am so grateful for my rehab experience here at Benchmark!"
"I have been to multiple Benchmark locations and Howell Mill is by far the best!! The entire staff is amazing and super friendly. Krysta and her trainees are all super knowledgeable and patient, and they really work with you to create a plan that pushes you without causing pain. Hopefully I don‚Äôt need physical therapy again in the future, but if I do this is the only place I would come!"
"Movement IS medicine! After living with MS for 20 years, I was beginning to have serious mobility issues earlier this year. I started working with this talented team in early Summer of 2019 to improve my gait, balance, and hip and leg strength. I have not needed to use the handicap parking decal for the last 8-10 weeks and counting! Thank you Howell Mill Benchmark PT for equipping me with a personalized exercise routine and instilling in me the mantra 'movement IS medicine'."
"My daughter was recovering from ankle surgery and needed therapy. She worked with PT Jessica who was amazing! After 6-7 sessions, my daughter's ankle/foot was much improved and she was able to start back to tennis after a few weeks. Benchmark was awesome - very professional and also motivational for the patients! Thank you!!"
"I came to benchmark with a grade 4 AC separation at the beginning of October, told my PT (Krysta) that I really wanted to golf before Christmas and her and the rest of the benchmark staff did whatever they could to help me reach my goals as quick as possible! Very friendly and welcoming environment packaged along with undoubtedly knowledgeable workers. 10/10 recommend!"
"My continued experience at Benchmark PT at Howell Mill has been incredible. I am an athlete who has had back pain for years, and I can confidently say this place has made the world of difference. I live in Midtown, and Cheo was able to fit me into an appointment when I was at my worst, so I travel to Howell Mill instead. My pain is diminishing each visit, and more importantly, the people are fantastic. Krysta is kind, patient and makes every session both fun and productive. I could not recommend this place enough. 10/10, 5 stars, number 1. Howell Mill has my personal endorsement."
"I've been with Krysta and the rest of the staff at Benchmark Howell Mill since late March and have seen more improvement in my short time here than I did at my previous physical therapy location, where I spent 7 long months. The staff is not only incredibly friendly but great caretakers. They make sure that your goals are met and that you leave each therapy session feeling better than when you arrived.  I have already recommended Krysta and her team to plenty of friends because I truly believe in the great work they put in and I know they will be in great hands. My quality of life has improved because of the team here and I am eternally grateful!"
"I love Benchmark- Howell mill! Everyone is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. I work with Jessica, she always makes me feel comfortable and knows her muscles and how to treat them! If my schedule doesn‚Äôt allow me to work with Jessica I work with Krysta, she‚Äôs very funny and really knows how to address your concerns. The rest of the staff is amazing and treat you like royalty!"
"I walked in with a painful lower back issue and now I am free of pain thanks to the wonderful staff at Benchmark Howell Mill. I worked closely with Krysta one of the ‚ÄúRockstars‚Äù plus an intern Delani at Benchmark. The team members worked in a effortless and seamless  manner to take care of my pain needs. Now I can go back and dance to soca music, once outside is open again. Thank you Benchmark for your service."
"I‚Äôm finishing up with my 2nd time at Benchmark, and while I hope I don‚Äôt need to go back, I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else for physical therapy. Jessica did a great job to help me get back on track with my arm. She and everyone else at Benchmark is super friendly and actually makes physical therapy a fun experience. Highly recommended to anyone that needs physical therapy!"
"I can't say enough good things about Jessica, Krista and the rest of the team at Benchmark Howell Mill.  They truly assess your needs and make sure that you progress week to week.  Although I am not back to 100% yet, I feel that my body is recovering more each time I work with the team here. Highly recommend this location."
"After 3years of chiropractor visits, 3 years on monthly massage therapy visits, my Dr. Recommended 6weeks of 2x per week therapy at Benchmark for chronic back pain. I noticed a stark reduction in pain after 6 visits. I continued for another 5 visits and happy to report, ""I'm pain free!"" My 3 years of suffering is over. THANK YOU PTs Krysta and Jessica. Thank you, Cheo for keeping my appointments on track."
Spencer and the team at Benchmark are absolutely wonderful. They really took the time to understand what my goals were. It was one of the easiest physical therapy experiences you could ask for.
"I'm grateful for the level of care I received at BenchMark - Howell Mill during my recent rehab following major shoulder surgery. Unfortunately, I'm no stranger to physical therapy (due to a variety of sports injuries and chronic back problems over the past 15+ years), so I have a basis for comparison. I can safely say that the therapists at BenchMark - Howell Mill are as knowledgeable and compassionate as any DPTs I've worked with. To be perfectly honest, I remain frustrated with my result, but that likely has more to do with the patient and the surgeon than the physical therapist(s)...hence the 5-star review. I have and will continue to recommend this facility to others seeking care or planning orthopedic surgery."
"Krysta and the team at BenchMark Howell Mill were beyond extraordinary! My first visit I was hooked! The entire staff are very welcoming and attentive. Krysta is very knowledgeable, outgoing and caring. I always look forward to my sessions with her. She's incredibly encouraging and each visit I could feel a difference! I finally graduated this week but if I ever have any other needs, I will most certainly be back!"
"Benchmark Howell Mill is the best I came here after a car accident, was in so much pain couldn't even move my neck which was the worst to go along with everything else that was hurting. Krysta was the absolute best making sure I was able to regain movement in my neck. I would recommend this location to anyone the entire staff is great starting with the front desk. MOTION IS LOTION!!!"
"Benchmark Howell Mill is a great place for physical therapy.  The staff is outstanding.  The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming.  Both my daughter and I receive PT at this location.  I‚Äôm especially impressed by the innovative strategies that are used for treatment.  Both Krysta and Jessica are fully invested in their patients‚Äô improvement.  They are knowledgeable about many assistive and ancillary aspects of therapy and treatment.  For instance, when my daughter was being treated for ACL reconstruction, Jessica suggested ergonomic crutches for her.  This made a world of difference for her mobility as she had to use crutches for 8 months.  I cannot say enough about the experience I have had at Benchmark-Howell Mill.  Although I live more that 25 miles away, I‚Äôd make the trip any day to receive the level of care that I have from these outstanding therapists."
"Physical therapy at Benchmark on Howell Mill has been an extremely pleasant and informative experience. The caring, friendly and motivational environment staffers create, provide a sense of mental and physical relief that make every visit, ""something to look forward to."" I've been privileged to recover with Anjanette Nunez, PT, DPT, an intellect, who is very professional, and absolutely phenomenal. Her charming personality, patience and willingness to listen leaves a great impression.  Anjanette is always attentive throughout my sessions, monitoring my comfort/discomfort, and ensuring proper form during exercises. Definitely a recommendation."
"I love this place! Everything about them is easy, professional and top notch! From making an appointment, to checking in, to the actual physical therapy, the individuals are again, very professional, friendly, flexible and easy to work with.

I love the young man at the check in desk, the young interns who are rotating through the clinic and even the fun music they play.

But the best thing is that I received relief almost immediately and my shoulder continues to get better with every visit. My physical therapist, Anjanette, who is also the clinic director is amazing. She explained the probable cause of my issue and explains what muscle every exercise is being targeted to strengthen.

I really can‚Äôt say enough good things about Benchmark Physical Therapy in Howell Mill."
"Love this place! They got me back to my normal after months of being in pain. My therapist Jessica was AWESOME, and made everything so much easier!!! Never a full moment!!!"
"I've actually been to this location twice, and each time, it's been a great experience.  Krysta is awesome, makes you feel totally comfortable, and is clearly very knowledgeable.  Although needing PT certainly isn't something I want to do, I do look forward to seeing the staff there, and working with them to get better.  I've had great results, and trust the team.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back here again."
"Highly recommend Benchmark Howell Mill Physical Therapy! Very welcoming group of professionals! Krysta is very knowledgeable, outgoing and caring. The whole staff pushes you to reach your therapy goals in a fun but very supportive environment. Graduated today and really appreciate all they did for me!"
"I came to this location because of the reviews and I had a choice of over 50 other physical therapy locations.  All the 5 star reviews are true.  I am glad I came here.  From the front desk to the physical therapy staff, this place is very fun, very effective, and you are really cared for.  Jessica is great, she's very funny, very knowledgable, and very caring!  She is the sweetest.  I had pain and now it's gone thanks to Jessica working with me. The other therapists are also great and the atmosphere is very fun and you can meet some very cool people too.  So come here to smile, laugh, heal, and get right!"
The experience here was great. I had issues with my left ankle it was very weak after a car accident. Jessica was my physical therapist and she made everything that I could not do possible for me to do by the end of my therapy. Everyone in Benchmark Physical Therapy made you feel at home and comfortable. Some things that may seem a little disturbing like dry needling for the first time was actually very awesome and helpful. I would definitely recommend dry needling if they feel that it would help in your situation. After all everything that I could not do weeks ago I graduated today and now I can do it. The push and the strive for excellence is real they care and they want to see the Improvement just as much as you do. I highly recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy on Howell Mill.
"Anjanette has helped me out on 3 different occasions. The best!  She always takes her time to listen about whats going on and is very  helpful and caring about my treatment.  The first time I was there I was having a hard time lifting my grandson and she wrapped some weights in a blanket (looked like a baby) and had me walk around exercising and lifting as I would a baby. Creativity and knowledge of what to do and when, she has my complete confidence. The whole staff seems to care for the patients, a good group.  I highly recommend the Benchmart Howell Mill Physical Therapy location."
I love Benchmark-Howell Mill! Krysta is my physical therapist and I can‚Äôt say enough how wonderful and attentive she is! She pushes me to reach my goals and is supportive the entire time! I have only been working with her for 3 weeks and can already walk without crutches and I am learning to walk without the boot!
"I love going to Benchmark Howell Mill ! I look forward to my therapy sessions because the staff is knowledgeable, professional and make the therapy process so much fun. This is my second time at Benchmark recovering from knee replacements. I do think the Howell Mill office is the best. Krysta has been perfect helping me with my physical therapy experience. I definitely recommend the Howell Mill office to anyone needing therapy. üòç"
"Actually, I'm Norman Miller.  I progressed much more than I thought I could.  All of the staff were very friendly and very knowledgeable.  My main therapist, Jessica, was always kind and encouraging but always insisting I could do more than I thought.  I would recommend this location to anyone."
Great experience.  Krysta and the entire team are really knowledgeable and helpful. I recommend this location for your therapy sessions.
"Pain is real. And it's a big deal that these people are so good at helping you overcome it instead of letting it drag down your life. I've had a few attempts at PT before but this place is far and away the best experience I've had. The attitude of the whole staff is consistently amazing. Scheduling is always hassle-free. And - most importantly of all - they really are talented doctors who've helped me heal in ways that continue to surprise even me. Thank you Krysta and everyone for all your guidance, help, encouragement and healing."
"This is a great facility with even greater people!  I recently had surgery for a torn meniscus.  I literally came to my first appointment on crutches.  After a lot of hard work with my physical therapist, Jessica, I‚Äôm now able to run in intervals. Jessica and the rest of the staff were friendly, great motivators and extremely patient... I strongly recommend this facility!"
"This is my second time in physical therapy in the last 2yrs, but first time for Benchmark. I feel 100% better in such a short amount of time. Anjanette is knowledgeable and concerned about my progress. Going through physical therapy isn't easy, but the staff here makes each appointment fun and exciting."
Went to benchmark after my knee surgery and it has been a great experience. My therapist jessica is amazing and was a great coach through my recovery.
"Krysta has quite literally changed my life! I could barely function in my day to day life, and I was experiencing very extreme pain levels. However, she has been working magic on my neck and back. I look forward to going to each and every appointment because I know I'll leave feeling immensely better than when I arrived! And just to top it all off, the entire staff is kind, caring, compassionate, and friendly! I simply cannot recommend this Howell Mill location enough."
"Benchmark Howell Mill is so great! They are professional, caring and make treatment fun. I especially love working with Krysta. She works so hard with all her patients and gets to know each of us personally."
Everyone here is amazing!  The ladies at the front have remembered my name from my very first visit and are always polite and welcoming. The therapists are so intuitive and listen‚Äîreally listen to what you have to say. They are just as dedicated to my recovery as I am.   I would 100% recommend Benchmark to anyone who needs PT.
Benchmark PT on Howell Mill is an excellent PT facility.   The staff is extremely knowledgable and cater to the needs of their clients.  The staff work together to insure that your PT is cohesive and effective . The atmosphere although professional is relaxed and soothing. I would highly recommend this facility.  Krysta was my treating therapist.
"Krysta and her team have been nothing short of perfect for what one could hope in a physical therapy experience.  Everyone at the clinic has been professional, knowledgeable, personable, and enthusiastic.  The whole team at Benchmark on Howell Mill makes going to physical therapy an enjoyable and productive experience.  I fully recommend their clinic to anyone  looking for a physical therapy provider."
"I can‚Äôt say enough wonderful things about the staff at BenchMark Howell Mill. Anjanette and Krysta are truly wonderful to work with making what can be seen as a very difficult stage in recovery actually enjoyable. You will feel encouraged, understood and supported when working with them and always feel uplifted by their wonderful personalities as soon you walk in the door. I would highly recommend coming to this location just to have the opportunity to work with them."
Awesome place! Friendly staff. Feeling so much better already!
Everyone that works at this location is great! I was referred over by a Neurologist for a pinched nerve. Within 10 minutes they had found the problem wasn't what the Neurologist said. They also did a much better job of explaining what was going on and the process of what we would be doing to help remedy the pinched nerve. My sessions continued to be helpful and knowledgeable. I absolutely recommend this location!
"Krysta and Anjanette were thoughtful, kind and supportive as they helped me recover from a dislocated elbow. I loved that they provided 'homework' with an app that shows you how to perform the excerises. Highly recommend."
"Jessica, Krysta and the whole staff were amazing in helping me recover from a car accident and getting me to my goals! If in any need for Physical Therapy, please see this staff!"
An excellent place.  Friendly knowledgeable service with a strong eye on achieving therapy goals.  They provided a great environment with a dedicated focus on the exercises and workouts that would help me restore my knee to full working condition.
"15 visits for back-hip. Professional, super friendly atmosphere, plus real help for the problem with results. Recommended!"
"My PT, Krysta was helpful and caring about me and my treatment.  She took the time to listen to me and to create the best treatment plan possible for the rehabilitation of my wrist. The staff were all professional and motivated to care for the patients. I highly recommend the Benchmart Howell Mill Physical Therapy location."
"Physical therapy is an incredibly difficult process, but the amazing staff at Howell Mill Benchmark honestly make coming into therapy as enjoyable as it could possibly be!"
"I had a great experience with Benchmark at Howell mill, very knowledgeable and caring staff, friendly and welcoming environment, Jessica and Bianca did an awesome job. I could tell they love what they are doing and it makes a huge difference in the quality of their service."
"This is the second Benchmark that I have been to and by far the best. Their main goal is total recovery with a focus on tools and skills that you can do outside of the office to further your therapeutic goals. Now u don't want to say that I have a favorite person here because they all are great, but her name begins with a K and an A at the end.  Haha!!!!!!!!!"
Best physical therapy team I‚Äôve ever had. I enjoyed everyone. Keep up the great work. Thanks everyone. Carol Dixon
I love benchmark and have progressed so much. No more back pain! Krysta is the best!!
"best group i have ever worked with, thanks for all your help getting me pain free, go jessica"
"After I had 3 car accidents back to back, injuring my neck and back in all three, I knew I needed proper treatment. I received a recommendation to try benchmark and had the option of going to this location or another. I‚Äôm so glad I picked this one. The entire staff treats you like family. They are flexible and highly effective at treatment, they got me better than before my injuries.

Lastly the environment is extremely comfortable and they have a GOOD music playlist every visit but the playlist would be GREAT if they added ‚Äú 30 Dollars‚Äù by David Wells ;)"
"Dr. Krysta and her wonderful team of professionals are courteous and knowledgeable! Her mastery of human anatomy is AMAZING. She was my third PT after many years of recovery and relapses. She is truly invested in her patients. Many thanks to Laura, Cheo, and Bianca as well."
"I had an awesome time with Jessica. She was patient, kind and very motivating! I saw a major transformation within a month. Remember always do your home excersies! The entire staff is friendly and helpful as well."
"I entered there clinic in a lot of pain never dreaming this would work- kyrsta and staff were fantastic- I am not an exercise person but they kept it interesting and fun- I did new things each visit which helped make it fun and not boring- I was almost sad to be cured- lol- they know just what to do , are very professional, punctual, and I was amazed how quickly i was relieved of my pain- i highly recommend using them- I dont think you could find a better place to go. i felt very lucky to have found them!"
The entire staff is amazing! You feel right at home! One big happy family. By far the best PT around!
Krysta and Anjanette Rocks!! I have been coming to this location since the end of December and when I tell you these two ladies has helped my elbow tremendously. They pretty much got my elbow back to where it was. I highly recommend this location.
Everyone was very friendly and helpful and Krystal was very focused on what I needed to do to reap maximum benefit from each session.  This made the session quite enjoyable.  Very pleased with the final outcome.
"I truly enjoyed my sessions at this location. Krysta and her student Kelly were very welcoming and knowledgeable, and did a great job returning my shoulder to baseline. :)"
"After going to PT here, I am finally waking up without back pain. I feel much better. The staff is fun as well, so all of my sessions were enjoyable."
Nice staff and very effective treatment. All are caring and kind but Anjanette is best therapist for pressure treatment. Their therapy has kept me walking in spite of a damaged spine.
"I like to come there everyone were so nice.
Jessica treated me like she cared about me.
Also the rest of the stuff were so good."
I was very happy with their customer care. All personnel are very professional and friendly. I highly recommend this place.
"Not only are the staff very welcoming and highly knowledgeable, but they're extremely fun and make what can be a very uncomfortable period of someone's life exciting and funny. I've been going for near three months and already there's a noticeable lack of pain in my day to day life. I couldn't recommend this place enough!"
"Best PT staff here, Krysta has helped me a lot in my recovery process and I know I‚Äôll be in an even better place than I was before my accident. Highly recommend this location for your PT"
I have been going to Maria Anjanette Nunez for close to 6 months. She has given me excellent treatment and I have improved immensely. I would highly recommend her.
So far... my physical therapy experience here has been great! Every day is a fun environment and I feel like everyone actually cares about me :) here‚Äôs to hoping surgery #4 and rehab at benchmark helps my knee!!
"From my first consultation to my graduation day here, everyone here treated me like their sister. I felt so at home here sometimes I didn't want my session to end. From my therapist Krysta, to Jessica, to the front desk with Chao and Hussain, it's such a awesome place to get therapy. I had so much fun getting rid of my back pain. Definitely a suggested place for everyone and anyone who needs physical therapy. Miss you guys, have fun healing people. Remember, if you ever need more Shea Butter I'm just a phone call awayüíôüíô"
"They are caring, professional, and super nice! I trust my family with Dr. Krista and the whole team!"
"These therapists are fantastic! Professional, knowledgeable, and caring. While I hope to never need PT again, I know where I would like to go if I need such assistance again."
"Thank you Jessica!

Where do I begin?

I ruptured my Achilles playing basketball and I knew this was a significant injury. Surgery was tough and I knew PT would be the differentiator in my recovery.

From the first day, every single person on staff helped me to feel like a champion. I left my first session with the same encouragement I carry today! I knew that it would be a long road ahead, but I looked forward to showing up every time because I knew I‚Äôd be challenged, while having a good time and feeling cared for.

You all truly convinced me that you cared about my progress just as much as I did. Some days even more lol. Working with Jessica was always a pleasure and she was the perfect match for someone like me who tends to act like everything is ok all the time. She could read my eyes and tell when she needed to dive deeper or push me further. I graduated from Benchmark with new friends and feeling even more empowered than before!

Unless you live very very far away, I‚Äôd recommend this location over the others and there‚Äôs absolutely no question about if you should choose Benchmark over another physical therapy office!"
I received the best care possible from Ms. Jessica Simon and her team of professionals. They made me feel my best self. Thx yall üíúüíúüíúüíïüíïüíãüíã
"Starting I've had a spinal fusion C5-C6 3-15-2018 due to a work injury at Delta Airlines. I spent around 2 months bed rest post surgery and have weakened considerably. I started my physical recovery at BenchMark 9-17-18 only able to lift 20lbs push 30lbs. Now at 10-24-18 I'm able to lift 100lbs, and push 200lbs. My endurance has drastically improved and have zero pain. The progress I've made while attending this location has met and exceeded my goals and has returned me to my pre injury strength in a very short amount of time. A big thanks to the staff and particularly to my therapists Jessica and Hussein who's positivity and professionalism is a distinct impact on ones drive to improve."
Great staff and care. They‚Äôve provided tailored exercises and treatments that have helped with back and hip pain I‚Äôve battled.
I had a very pleasant experience at Benchmark therapy-Howell Mill. They concentrated on the areas needed in order for me to walk again w/o pain after a foot fracture. never had to wait when arriving for an appointment.
I attended Benchmark Physical Therapy Howell Mill location for severe sciatic nerve inflammation. Anjanette and the team provided dry needling therapy that provided some immediate relief while also working with me on a series of exercises to address the affected area. After a handful of weekly sessions I was back to doing my day to day activities.
Absolutely recommend! Everyone here was very attentive and caring with my treatment. One of the best treatments I've received!
"Krysta is a very vibrant person. Even, on your worst day in PT she makes everything feel like a breeze. I came into therapy limping in with pain level high as a 9. Now, I‚Äôm walking straight with bearable pain. The energy of this clinic is off the charts. Which is one reason I believe help me be able to push through the pain. Thanks Krysta you have been a blessing."
"Made the grueling rehab process very pleasurable, very knowledgeable and fun to be around, I hope I never get injured again, but if I do at least I could go back there and I know I would be in good hands

Thanks a lot y'all"
"Benchmark Physical Therapy Howell Mill has been a life saver for me! I injured my hip at work back in May and have since been working through my injuries by doing physical therapy. Anjanette is my Physical Therapist and she is AMAZING! She is infectiously positive and genuinely one of the greatest people to be around. She is incredibly attentive to her patient‚Äôs needs. (Even allowing the occasional vent session/giving life advice) ‚ù§Ô∏è

Staying motivated and positive when you are in great pain is difficult to say the least. Every time I come into Benchmark, I leave my worries and pessimism at the door. I am treated like family as soon as I walk in. Being greeted by name by Cheo at the door, doing whale tails with Hussain, and making fun of country music to get under Krysta‚Äôs skin are just a few of the many things that keep me coming back. I have full belly laughed, have cried on occasion, have had minor setbacks, and major victories along the way. No matter what kind of day I‚Äôm having, I leave in a better mood feeling physically and mentally refreshed! I would 100% recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy to anyone that is ready to leave their pain at the door and start the road to physical recovery. I promise you will leave much stronger than when you walked in!"
Love it here! The Staff is always wonderful and polite.I look forward to going each week.
Krysta and Hussein are phenomenal! I strongly recommend this location for your PT needs.
"Excellent care and service. Therapists lead by Ms. Anjanette Nunez, PT  are smart and kind. Thanks for your help. Bhimesh G."
"I have a history of injuring my left ankle, and both times I've done PT here I feel more stable and comfortable after every session. The whole team is excellent :)"
Knowledgeable staff who accepts feedback. They enjoy their patients and applaud both you small and large victories.
"I tore my ACL and meniscus in Tae Kwon Do two years ago and was at the lowest I‚Äôd ever been. I didn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd ever get back to doing what I loved. Anjanette helped me get my confidence back up and got me back on track faster than I anticipated. I‚Äôve come back in for minor injuries and concerns, but she still treats them like any other. If it matters to you, no matter how minor, it matters to her. There‚Äôs a strong trust level that I have with her and the other therapists at the Howell Mill location that puts me at ease and allows me to continue kicking with no worries."
Jessica was great got me up and running üòâGreat therapy place to go to
"I started therapy @ BM on Howell Mill almost 2 weeks ago. I cannot speak highly enough about the full range of my experience thus far. I will start with the scheduling process. The front desk person who assisted me over the phone was Cheo. Cheo was so kind and professional and told me exactly what I needed for my appointment. I arrived and was greeted by Cheo who was patient with me as I rummaged nervously through my huge handbag. I met with the Director Krista and she was so professional and immediately I felt like I was in great hands! Krista worked some MAGIC and after even my first session my pain drastically decreased. So far I am so happy with the treatment and service AND the environment at Bench Mark on Howell Mill. A truly amazing caring staff and helpful place to go when you are in need.
I am almost afraid to heal too quickly, I will miss everyone there! Cheo, Krista, Blonde Doll ( I never got her name :) , Bianca , & Hussein).

THE BEST THERAPY I HAVE RECEIVED. 5 STARS"
Amazing staff!! They really care about you and getting you better. No matter what.
These guys do great work!!
Jessica was great she pushed me just hard enough to improve my range of motions in my neck. They do a great job and I will suggest Benchmark on Howell Mill to everybody
This place by far is the best physical therapy clinic in the metro area the staff is caring professional and very knowledgeable about their practice.
"The staff at Benchmark Therapy Howell Mill take extra care, I would highly recommend!"
The therapists are very nice and very helpful!!?
The entire team at Benchmark - Howell Mill location was fabulous.  Andrew and Alex are wonderful therapist.  I had rotator cuff surgery and was using my arm in an appropriate amount of time.  The rest of the staff was excellent at keeping up with my insurance (who of course didn't want to coopoerate)



The entire staff at this clinic is amazing! They‚Äôre so friendly and the atmosphere is so pleasant. Krysta is possibly the best PT in the Atlanta area. I‚Äôve been seeing her for about two months now and she‚Äôs really made a difference. Krysta is the best at what she does and it shows through her actions. She‚Äôs incredibly thoughtful - she knew of an injury I had with my toes (that I wasn‚Äôt even there for technically) and found an exercise for me to do for them. She goes above and beyond at all times! I highly recommend Krysta and this location!
"I absolutely love Benchmark Physical Therapy.  The therapists here are all amazing and really listen to you and do anything they can to get you back to yourself.  I've never had a more pleasant experience making appointments. They make it so easy, and their winning personality makes it even better. I would refer Benchmark to anyone."
"My time at benchmark Avondale was seamless and beneficial. I couldn't be happier with the work Johnathan and the team did. They were accommodating, attentive and knowledgeable. Didn't think I would recover well after my accident but they accomplished the impossible! Thanks again."
"Great service, good energy. Folks there are knowledgeable and flexible. Helped me literally get back on my feet quickly."
My husband has Physical Therapy here. Krista is wonderful..She takes great care of us. Love the environment here. All the staff creates a warm atmosphere that gives us confidence to meet our challenges and goals. Thanks Benchmark
"Benchmark Avondale has a superb team that is well knowledgeable, they create an awesome atmosphere for healing and recovery. They work so well as a team with clients and anyone that enters the door. As I improved through the healing pain of it all, they always positively cheer and encouraged your accomplishments. Go Team Benchmark Avondale..
10 STARS"
"My middle school aged daughter needed PT after having her broken elbow surgically repaired. A friend recommended BenchMark, and we've been so thrilled. Jonathan has done a great job of establishing a rapport with my daughter. He is fantastic at explaining the various exercises to her and why she's doing them. Additionally, he makes the hour sessions fun and engaging. We're so glad to be part of BenchMark."
"Krysta is an amazing PT. She is friendly and makes you feel like you are her only patient.  Punctuality and timeliness are important to me and she easily checked those boxes.  I saw Krysta for lower back pain without a specific injury.  She targeted the problem and engaged me in strengthening activities that I learned in clinic and could continue at home.  I quickly began to feel better!  She gauged my progress and discharged me in a timely fashion.  I was so impressed!  I would recommend Krysta to any of my friends, family members, or patients."
"I highly recommend Benchmark. The physical therapists are very professional and extremely friendly. They make physical therapy a pleasure. I pulled some muscles in my lower back while gardening. Now, after therapy, I‚Äôm back to gardening and to my daily walks. I can‚Äôt say enough about the entire staff, especially Jonathan, who made me look forward to PT, even the wall sits!"
The atmosphere here is filled with so much positive energy. They help heal your body and spirit. I'm so much better and I really enjoy each visit. Thanks so much!
Thank you Jonathan and staff for helping me with my physical therapy you guy's really help me and i would recommend this location to anyone who need service cause the staff really work together to help you get well
"I cannot say enough good things about Krysta and Benchmark Physical Therapy! After having an accident at work that caused major spine issues, Krysta helped treat me at the Howell Mill Benchmark location. I was in her care for 7 months before surgery and went back post surgery for an additional 2 months to strengthen my back. The level of care and expertise that she exhibits is second to none. I actually used to look forward to going to PT because Krysta and the team were so positive and fun! They made my recovery process seem so much less alone by encouraging me and pushing me to my limits each time I walked through the door. Even if I was having a bad day and didn‚Äôt feel like being there, their energy was infectious and I left feeling happier. I know it sounds dramatic, but Krysta and team literally helped save my life when I really didn‚Äôt think recovery was possible. If you are a new patient thinking about working with Krysta, don‚Äôt think any longer. DO IT! You are in the best hands in the industry under her care!"
"Great staff. Very professional, friendly and caring. Keep up the awesome work.

JP
Go Bucks!"
"I was in a car accident December of 2019 and needed PT for my back and shoulder. Krysta was amazing! She took the time to really understand my condition, set personalized goals with me for what recovery would look like, and created a tailored plan of exercises that really restored my mobility. I could barely use my left shoulder when we started our sessions, and after 5 months of rehab I felt like a new woman! Krysta's bright and encouraging personality always made our sessions enjoyable, even when the exercises were tough! And Cheo at the front desk is simply delightful! He always has a smile and a jovial attitude, and he definitely made coming in early in the mornings a LOT more pleasant. He also greets patients by name, which is really nice, because it makes you feel like you're more than just a patient. If you ever need physical therapy, I would HIGHLY recommend coming to see Krysta, you won't find better care or service anywhere!"
"I came to benchmark for neck and knee pain earlier this year and had a wonderful experience working with Krysta. She has such an upbeat, outgoing personality that makes physical therapy an enjoyable experience that I actually looked forward to each appointment. She cares about each of her patients and is dedicated to developing a care plan that is specific to your individual needs. I would highly recommend Krysta and her practice and would absolutely return if I need physical therapy in the future."
"I had a MAJOR tear (SLAP) in my left shoulder and it was excruciating to live and sleep. Physical therapy was my last resort before major surgery. I came to the practice as a big skeptic on physical therapy. Within weeks (not months) Krysta and her team were able to get my shoulder to the point where I noticed significant improvement. After a couple of months of treatment, I am fully rehabilitated and have full range of motion in my shoulder. The practice staff is so kind  and professional.. They truly treat you and care for you like family. I would go back and refer all my loved ones for all Physical Therapy needs 5 stars! 10 stars if I could!"
"Krysta was an awesome physical therapist. All of the staff members are great. If you're ever injured and in need of a great and friendly atmosphere, don't hesitate to call or stop by.üòä"
"Krysta Posid and the staff at Benchmark Therapy are incredible.  They are knowledgeable, professional and quite helpful.  Both my daughter and I have had to utilize their services over the past 6 months.  Krysta was accommodating and always willing to help explain why they were prescribing particular exercises and how they would help heal the injury.  Highly recommend!!!"
"I met Krista in 2018.  When I went in for my evaluation during my medical leave I knew I found a truly special place because I felt like I was home. Working with Krista has been so rewarding that I made sure to return to her for a follow up treatment now in 2020 when my injury pains started to flare up again. Krista is a great leader, coach, mentor, therapist, and friend. She makes all her patients feel at home and creates a fun productive environment in which everyone feels like a big family. Her personalized attention and rapport with her patients truly takes health ‚Äúcare‚Äù to the next level."
"I love Benchmark on East College and all of the team. They are thorough, fun, and customer service is amazing! My hip felt much better after  first visit already!"
Krysta and Jonathan are absolutely wonderful!! I always looked forward to my PT sessions and I have made a complete recovery!
"Krista worked with both my daughters who had various sports injuries.  She took the time to know and understand their sport and their injuries so she could best assist them.  Both my daughters looked forward to going to PT.  She was able to relate to them and impress upon them the importance of PT and how long term it would benefit them.  They are better now but still do PT at home to keep strong.  For me, as a parent I always felt Cheo did everything to make the process easy from scheduling, billing, and walking me through the process.  No doubt if I ever had to go back we would see Krista for sure!  Keep up the good work!!"
"Krysta has been my PT for a few months, helping me recover from a broken foot.  She makes the visits fun and functional at the same time. I appreciate how she takes time to listen to my concerns and shows genuine care in my recovery.  Cheo is always helpful scheduling my appointments and provides the best customer service.  He and Krysta are true assets to Benchmark Physical Therapy and I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased."
This location is new and Krysta and Cheo make me feel special every time I come in. They are able to individualize my physical therapy needs and make me feel like family. All the equipment is new and their cleanliness is exceptional. They go above and beyond every time and it‚Äôs a pleasure to have them as part of my personal care team.
"Krista is the best. I saw her for dry needling. Although I almost jumped off the table multiple times and whimpered like a baby, she professionally and gently pressed on! And sure enough, the dry needling was a game changer. Do not hesitate to see Krista and her team. You are in good hands."
"Benchmark was a 10/10 experience for me. I came into PT with a severe back injury, and thought I needed surgery. Instead, Krysta did an incredible job of helping me get to a point of comfort and finding creative ways to still do the things and sports I love. I cannot recommend her enough! Cheo was also amazing at the front desk. I never thought I would look forward to going to Physical Therapy, but I can genuinely say that I miss it and the team at Benchmark."
"I treated with Krysta about a year ago for a broken ankle I suffered. To say the least she was absolutely amazing. She was super patient and knowledgeable about my needs and my condition. She never rushed my progress but applied the perfect amount of aggression to never let me get too comfortable! Of course, I never want to break a bone again but if I do I know exactly who I will be treating with üòä"
Wonderful people. Amazing care. Great atmosphere. Couldn‚Äôt recommend this place too highly.
"I cannot say enough about Krysta and the staff here. I've been going for a few weeks for back pain.  Krysta walks you through her plan for you very clearly. If you ask questions, they're answered. Moreover, Krysta and her team are personable and show compassion for their patients.  They are also very punctual, I haven't had to wait at all.   I can also say, I've seen Krysta and her team be very mindful of Covid-19 hygiene practices and cleaning all of the equipment.   Parking is also close and free.  Scheduling is easy.  I would definitely recommend Krysta and this Benchmark Team.  Thanks y'all! I really needed this positive experience after having a bad experience with my primary care doctor."
"The entire team at Benchmark physical therapy in Avondale, is extremely fun, courteous and professional. After suffering from a extremely bad third degree burn from a lightening strike and a subsequent fire, Benchmark physical therapy was my last hope for pain relief. After some trial and error with other methods of pain relief, Benchmark truly helped me feel better and closer to normal for the first time in six months. Krysta & Cheo are two of the nicest people I have ever met & had the pleasure of working with. I truly look forward to all my appointments three days a week. This is the best gym membership I've ever had. (honest) I truly want to thank Benchmark for hiring this awesome team and I'm honestly grateful I found them for my pain relief. I highly recommend this location for treatment"
"If you are lucky enough to get into see Krysta, then you have won the lottery!   She is by far The Best PT person I have ever used!  I have 4 grown kids who played multiple sports with multiple injuries, and we have much experience  going to many PT therapists around Atlanta. And she is by far The best, truly AMAZING!  Krysta is extremely knowledgeable and very experienced at healing injuries. She is brilliantly good at getting right to the heart of the problem and helping you feel better.
On top of it all, she and her adorable side kick Cheo are about the nicest people Ive ever met.  We are so sad to have them leave our neighborhood.  You are so fortunate to have these phenomenal people in Decatur!  We will miss you ya'll so much!"
"Krysta and Cheo are amazing. Cheo is always very welcoming and takes the time to build relationships with the clients. Krysta is the BEST! Wonderful person with a beautiful personality!  Both my daughter and I have benefited from her expertise for several sports injuries. Even if she has multiple patients, she provides excellent personal care! They create the best atmosphere for healing!"
"I saw Krysta for a patellar tendon injury. I was in considerable pain and walking with great difficulty when I arrived. I couldn‚Äôt believe how quickly I felt better after my first session! Don‚Äôt ask me to explain it but the pain-relief therapy worked so well that I was walking with almost no pain by the time I left that day.
Obviously, I still had to go through the rehab/strengthening program but  not being in pain made that a much more positive experience.
Krista is fun, personable and gifted.  And Cheo, who runs the front office, is a pleasure to be around. He is efficient, friendly and helpful.
I highly recommend telling your orthopaedist to refer you to Benchmark in Decatur-Avondale."
My experience at Benchmark has been stellar. The staff is amazing and want to ensure that you return to your best self after injury. I would recommend them to anyone!
"The staff is amazing. The perfect mix of professionalism and friendliness. I‚Äôve been getting migraines for years and with PT, my neck is less stiff and I feel a whole lot better."
"After suffering with knee pain in both knees for months I went to Krysta for a solution. After just a few visits, I was able to return to all of my normal sports and workouts, pain free. Although many physical therapists probably could have fixed my knee pain, not many could have made me enjoy the experience the way Krysta did. In addition to Krysta, Cheo made the experience wonderful! He always greeted me by name and with a smile when I walked through the door. Hopefully I don‚Äôt need any future physical therapy, but if I do, I know exactly who I‚Äôll be calling!"
"This place is the BOMB!   Everyone is so nice, following COVID protocol, and is a great addition to the Decatur-Avondale area!   Don‚Äôt hesitate to use them!!"
"Coming from a recent hip surgery, I wanted to find a clinic that will help me reach my goals to return back to my normal activities. Krysta has been my therapist and she is a one of the most well rounded physical therapist I‚Äôve been to! She will educate you on your injury and help you reach your goals! Also with Cheo as the office coordinator, he makes sure you are well informed with all things insurance and scheduling. You will definitely find your best care here at Benchmark Decatur-Avondale!!"
Krista is a wonderful Physical Therapist! Her upbeat personality makes your experience enjoyable. She really cares about her patients and it shows.
Dr. K is the best. She got my shoulder back to the point that I could go back the the gym again for my 1st injury. My 2nd injury I was living in Texas and would fly back the Atlanta 2-3 times a week just to see her. The rest of the staff is awesome also
"I would leave 10 stars if I could! I tore my PCL in January of 2020. Benchmark has handled all of my recovery and currently I am down to 1x per month maintenance visits with Krysta. She is an amazing therapist! The care and patient service that Cheo and Krysta provide from the front door to the table is like no other. Genuine care and good customer service are so hard to find these days, but you will definitely find it here!"
I've been visiting Krysta for two years. Her mastery of human anatomy and physical therapy for pain management is AMAZING! She knows when and where I have pain before I actually feel the pain. I have not felt this good in a long time all thanks to Krysta and the professional team (Cheo and Bianca) at Benchmark PT. You will get many referrals from me!
"Krysta and Cheo are the absolute best! Krysta is the most experienced and caring PT that I've ever worked with in my 25 years of service to the country! Cheo is a really great receptionist and an overall great guy! He has always worked with me on my schedule and is extremely polite and friendly EVERYTIME I visit!

I've been working with both of them for the past 9 months after a shoulder surgery and they both have become like family to me! I will refer all of my family and friends to this location. If you want caring, knowledgeable and results-based PT, this is the place for you!"
"Krista and Cheo are the best. Krista is always willing to work with my schedule when I need to change my appointment. Cheo is very helpful when I have a question about my insurance. Physical therapy can be stressful at times and to help ease the stress,  you need people who are willing to work with you no matter what."
"Cheo and Krysta are both great, when I first call to make an appointment and I expressed to Cheo how much pain I was experiencing he got me in immediately the next day. As soon as you walk in he makes you feel so welcomed and comfortable very professional. Krysta was very dedicated to getting me put back together because when I first came I couldn't even move my neck and was experiencing so much pain in my back. She was always right by my side motivating me let me know you got this, even sings sometimes always up beat. I would most definitely recommend to anyone. Thanks again Krysta and Cheo for the terrific service"
"I saw Krysta for almost a year for two consecutive bilateral ACL surgeries and I could not recommend Krysta and her team more if you are looking for a physical therapist. It is strange to say a physical therapy experience was fun, but I looked forward to going to this clinic each time and was it was bittersweet the day I graduated. From the first day, it was easy to see what a family everyone is, and they welcome you right in. Seeing Cheo at the front desk was always one of my favorite ways to start and end each session and he remember me from day one. Finally, Krysta is a unique balance of expertise, humility, and interpersonal tact. My first recovery was quick and undoubtedly because I followed Krysta's direction. Even more amazingly, following a pre-habilitation for my second ACL surgery, my second recovery was even quicker. She develops her team and genuinely cares for everyone under her care. Her unwavering positivity made each day fun and is a sincere expression of her passion for physical therapy. I miss them all but hope this connects others with a great physical therapy team."
"Greetings everyone,
I came to BenchMark as a referral from my orthopedic specialist Dr. Absi to get rehab on my right shoulder which had been injured in a car accident.  Krysta Posid was my therapist , she was very warm and had a caring spirit about her, whenever I went ion for my therapy I always went in a made the whole team laugh with my great sense of humor....As part of my therapy we tried two treatments( cupping and fine needle aspirations) both of which I've never tried before and each one she explained the procedure and how it would also help.

Cheo who was the front desk clerk always greeted the clients with a smile and made us all felt welcomed whenever we entered the building and when we left he always told us to have a great day and see us on our next visit.

If you are visiting BenchMark and have the pleasure of meeting these two individuals I promise you won't regret meeting them in person or working with them."
"I walked in with a painful lower back issue and now I am free of pain thanks to the wonderful staff at Benchmark (Krysta and Cheo). I worked closely with Krysta one of the ‚ÄúRockstars‚Äù and many others at the facility. The team worked in a effortless and seamless  manner to take care of my pain needs.
I am so happy that I found them to assist with my pain needs.
Thank you Krysta and Cheo of Benchmark for your service."
"So excited to have Krysta head up a Benchmark closer to my home and equally as excited to have Cheo's smile greeting us at the front! This is a solid and warm-feeling group of people who make rehabbing and working out a little more enjoyable! The plus side to this warm and fuzzy feeling is the work they actually put in to make sure you leave every session a little less in pain and a little stronger! I never thought I'd say this but I actually looked forward to ""working out"" every week lol! I'll never go to any other physical therapist ever again!

Best of luck Krysta and Cheo!!"
"Customer service and customer care are the cornerstones to a successful business because they provide faith in the product being sold or provided--such is the allure of the BenchMark Physical Therapy team of Cheo and P.T. Krysta Posid.
Cheo is a fantastic office manager that made me feel like a family-member for whom he was responsible, ensuring that each visit was comfortable and safe.
The customer care that PT Krysta provided was sublime. I had spent several years with other therapists with no relief until my doctor referred me to BenchMark.
The BenchMark team provided a plan of treatment that has been life-changing: No more pain!
Thank you! Cheo and Krysta"
Very friendly! An awesome team!
"Awesome place. Aweso.e staff.
Awesome, awesome,  Awesome!!!!!!"
Hard work but great results!
Very Good Job!!!!!!



"IF YOU ARE BLACK, DO NOT COME HERE!!!
AN AWFUL PLACE! THE NURSES ARE EXTREMELY RUDE AND THEY WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO VISIT YOUR OWN FAMILY. Please be careful of allowing your loved ones to stay here!"
This is the most incredible group of physical therapists I've ever had the pleasure to work with!  Never underestimate the value of PT. It is a high value part of returning to life's activities after a health issue. Because of Covid masks are required and the PTs clean everything after use. I highly recommend this group!
"My son has gone here for PT/OT for over a year. He said his therapist's names before he said ""Grandma"". Natalie is fantastic! Willow, Kristin, and Angie are also great! We haven't technically been seen by the speech therapist, Laura, but she has given us tips and resources and always offered to help us anyway. They are all very sweet. Thank God for them, my boy is better off because of their patient work."
"Always clean,the people are always very nice, friendly and professional."
"Disorganized, understaffed and poor record keeping!  Find another place !"

"The therapists at the Midtown Benchmark are personable, knowledgeable and helpful. I was treated by three of them, and received excellant treatment from all three. So, if you select this location, you are guaranteed to have an experience of healing with empathy.

I moved to Buckhead and wanted to continue my treatment at the Buckhead location. I have requested an appointment online twice and left a message, with no response. So, I will go back to Midtown."
"I started physical therapy after months of an ongoing neck injury. Going to Benchmark was the best decision. I saw results quickly - and after 4-5 weeks I was pain-free and back to my normal activities. I can‚Äôt recommend them enough, especially Jenny who was the perfect blend of helpful, friendly and professional. Thank you!"
"Kelsey is a fantastic PT, had a great experience going there for over 3 months. Everyone was super friendly. Kelsey is a very supportive, empathetic and highly knowledgeable PT.
Thanks for all the Support

Barj"
I have used this location of Benchmark twice now. The first time for help with a herniated disc in my back and this time for foot pain issues. The location is convenient and the therapist both knowledgeable and engaging.
"The staff at this location is professional and caring. I worked with Kelsey over two months on my recovery from an injury. She was amazing and always attentive to the feedback. She cares for her patients and is deeply invested in her patients‚Äô recovery. Overall, consummate professional.."
"Had a great experience here recovering from shoulder surgery. Jenny and all of the staff were knowledgeable, professional, effective, and fun to be around even at 8am when your shoulder hurts. Highly recommend."
I am working with both Jenny and Maggie and I couldn't have asked for a better team of professionals. They have both taken the time to listen to me and gain a true understanding of my injuries and my goals for recovery. They work together to develop a personalized plan for me and are constantly assessing my progress and readjusting as needed. I have never been more excited about my recovery and it's because of the support I have from my team at Benchmark!
Great experience! Knowledgeable and friendly staff helped me recover from a shoulder injury. I highly recommend BenchMark Midtown for physical therapy
Benchmark PT midtown has a very professional atmosphere. Kelsey Harms is a great PT and listens to your needs. She is skilled and knowledgeable and gives great massages!
"I really enjoyed my experience with BenchMark Midtown. I had been having foot pain for over a year and couldn't get better no matter what I did. After switching to a different doctor, physical therapy was recommended to me, so I chose BenchMark Midtown since it was nearby. It was a great choice! The program my therapist (Kelsey) put together was great and I saw results over time and now I'm pain free! Kelsey was awesome and everyone who worked there was super friendly. A really great and enjoyable environment in every way while also professional and dedicated to each person's recovery. It was really easy to get in touch with Kelsey and BenchMark, and they also have a free app that shows you all of your work outs with videos and instructions. I definitely recommend BenchMark Midtown!"
"I did pre and post surgery PT, so I spent a year working with the amazing team at Benchmark Midtown. Even though Kelsey was my primary therapist, I got to know everyone and to see how they worked with patients. I would recommend this group to anyone who need PT of any kind. They are knowledgeable and caring--and they all have a great sense of humor. PT can be really difficult, but they make it as tolerable as possible. Most importantly, they move you through recovery and get positive results. I'm glad I live nearby so I can stop by occasionally to say hello because I'm really going to miss seeing them!"
"After injuring my shoulder, Kelsey and BenchMark PT helped me rehab back and avoid surgery. All the exercises were well designed to help gain strength and range of motion. Highly recommend for your PT needs!"
Very professional and pleasant staff. Very clean space. They know their stuff and will get you right.
After prolonged illness I was nearly bed ridden with sciatica. I was lucky to be referred to Benchmark. Erica was my care provider. She was superlative. It took longer than I hoped but the results are great and I learned about my body!
"Kelsey at Benchmark saved me from surgery. I did not have a lot of hope of success when I first showed up, but with the work there and at home I made great progress. The entire staff is great there!"
"Jonathan was phenomenal! I tore my Achilles in mid-April and under Jonathan''s care I have quickly recovered and already back playing sports.  Additionally, the staff is extremely friendly and made physical therapy enjoyable. I have completed physical therapy several times for various injuries, and this has been the best clinic I've seen."
"I'M SO THANKFUL THAT I WAS REFERRED HERE! ! !  THE STAFF IS FRIENDLY , PROFESSIONAL,  CONSIDERATE, LOVING AND HILARIOUS! ! !  LOVE THESE GUYS! I'M GOING TO MISS ""MY SWEET PEA ""!  PLEASE KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK,  GUYS!!! YOU ROCK!"
"I have had many sports injuries and I have always been opposed to physical therapy. I have always felt that they try to keep you there as long as possible (even if you are only seeing minor improvements) to have a constant revenue stream. This is NOT the case with Benchmark midtown. Alli and Rachel really push you and have a vested interest in seeing their patients make substantial progress. They take their work seriously and are a lot of fun to work with. Benchmark Midtown has definitely changed my opinion of physical therapy as a medical option, and I will continue to go to this location for all of my current and future needs."
I love them very friendly helpful and loveable. A very motivating place to heal.
"I have to say when my doctor told me I had to have physical therapy I was UPSET. I been down this path before with my knee ,so I knew what to expect but I was wrong I met dome really great people Sam ,Sara, Allison, Holly,Rachel ,and Christina who was not my therapist but was so nice even tho we didn't have to interact much I kno them by name because they made each visit personable . I may had a different therapist once or twice but they picked up where I left off . This group is very energetic and all about rehabilitating their client. I can't forget Rebecca whom I met on the last day but was awesome as well. I will recommend this location to everyone. Thank you all of you for helping me on my road to recovery. ROLLL TIDE LOL"
"If there's a better place for physical therapy on earth, I have yet to find a better one than Benchmark Physical Therapy, Midtown.

I have been to every TP practitioner from LA to Chicago to NYC, and my discovery of Benchmark in Midtown Atlanta was the best single decision of my life.  While most PT places are cold and uncaring, Benchmark is friendly and supportive.  Where most PTs just ""go through the motions"" of helping you, showing you a few boring exercises and telling you to ""roll on the big ball..."", Benchmark
explains and demonstrates a level of expertise that I never even knew existed, anywhere.  Until now.

It started the moment I just picked them from a big list I got from my physician.  The first person I talked to was an incredibly thoughtful woman named, 'Holly,' who moved heaven and earth to get me in as soon as possible, after I'd torn my rotator cuff from my arduous relocation to ATL.  But meeting my therapist, one Sam Crowley, was the greatest single experience I've ever had with any
therapist of the past 27-years.  His understanding of physical therapy (he has a doctor degree in the profession... rare indeed) and his THOROUGHNESS, PROFESSIONALISM, AND ABILITY TO PROVIDE ME NEARLY MIRACULOUS RELIEF FROM MY DEBILITATING PAIN WAS SOMETHING TO BEHOLD.  I have never had anyone actually use physical manipulation to provide immediate relief, and exercises so perfectly suited to getting my mobility back.  In my second week, he even introduced a form of accupuncture for my injury that gave me even MORE pain relief.  Unbelievable.  Now, instead of dreading going to my PT, I actually look forward to it!  The ""vibe"" at Benchmark is more like visiting with friends than fixing your painful injuries.

If you value your health, if you're looking for someone with the ability to give you the hands-on care you deserve, if you're looking for the best in the business, look no further.  Please give Benchmark Midtown a call, and please tell their entire staff that I personally told you to contact these marvelous, thoughtful people.  I feel blessed just have found them."
jenny is the best! üòä




"This was a new experience for me.  I remember walking in thinking this is just like the gym, I do not want to get help in front of all of these people on different tables. I had never been to Physical Therapy before, so walking in here felt so intimidating.  I called my husband & told him, and he said you'll be fine.  And I was.  From the very beginning, setting up the appointments, to coming in, and leaving the building my experience has been so wonderful.  My instructor's were heaven sent & when I say patient is an understatement.   If I wasn't doing something correct, they would always assist properly.  I went there not knowing what to expect & completed the PT with some added knowledge that I can take away & continue in my daily activities.  I appreciate each & everyone of the staff at this facility & if I ever had to do PT again, I know without a doubt where I will be attending.  Thanks again for the superior service, it was graciously appreciated!!!!"
"Amazing!!! Really have enjoyed all of my therapy sessions. Mr. Basil was my primary provider and he was very sweet and knowledgeable. As a patient, I have felt very cared for through the process of my recovery from my accident. Haley was so sweet and awesome as well. Katrina and Diane were always helpful with my appointments. Truly an awesome office to receive care. Thank you Benchmark Snellville."
"I had a bad ankle sprain and chose to do my PT at this Benchmark. I had Justin Mathew as my PT and have nothing but good things to say. He was very professional, knowledgeable, caring, and personable. He worked diligently to make sure I was progressing and fully recovered before I was done.  Everyone else at the facility was friendly as well. I‚Äôm glad to say that I was able to regain full mobility of ankle and get back to doing what I love. Thank you Justin and the staff at Benchmark!"
"I started physical therapy at this clinic after my ACL surgery in January. Four months later I am back to walking, running, jumping, and doing all sorts of workouts, thanks to my amazing PT Justin Matthew. He is extremely professional, knowledgeable, and personable. He truly cared about my progress and pushed me to meet my goals. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about Justin and everyone who works there!"
"I have never been to Physical Therapy before and did not know what to expect but i loved every minute of it! Lina was my instructor and she was wonderful! If I wasn't doing something correctly she would tell me how to do it right. Sometimes she had another patient she was working with and i would keep on doing the exercise she gave me until she was finished (it was only a couple of minutes but i made good use of it). I came a long way with being off balance!  If I ever need Physical Therapy again, i will definitely go there!"
I would like to thank basil and the staff for helping me with my lower back injury I hope I will continue to heal and be stronger  please if u are in need of HEALING please go to benchmark physical therapy
"I have to say the whole staff here makes it easy to heal no matter what you are going through. Their positive attitudes, passion for their patients, and dedication to their jobs make it truly feel like you are surrounded by angels. I know a lot about patient care because I work for three to the top dentist in the nation and we deliver the ritz Carlton of care to our patients daily. Positive energy is a must when someone touches you and it helps you to heal. I‚Äôm not going into the severity of what I‚Äôm having to go through but I can truly tell each and every staff member has helped me to heal not only with their hands but their hearts. I always say when providers chain out quality of care decreases, well they have truly proven me wrong. They deliver the best care and I wouldn‚Äôt trust anyone else to help me to heal more than them."
"I believe in receiving something of value for the money I pay a company for a product or service that is rendered. I was charged an outrageous fee, 235 dollars, to check my blood pressure and then was told they couldn't treat me because the numbers were too high. They called this an ""evaluation"", and that this was the customary fee. I cannot recommend them to anyone."
"Ok I have been coming here for quite some time with my wife and since coming here there has been a clear shift in management and not for the best.  Queen is very, very RUDE.  at my wifes appointments I sit down and watch Queen walk around acting like shes better than everyone else. Her name speaks for herself.  she does not help ANY of the other gentle and kind co-workers of hers that I have spent many nights with.  there are two types of managers, 1) those who work with their employees, and those who make a paycheck.  you can guess how this company runs things.  PAYCHECKS IT IS!!!!!

spend your money and time somewhere else.  this is supposed to be a place of improvement but I don't know how anyone is to improve with Queens attitude the way it is

if you do go here i do recommend seeing Lina or Boyd.  they are very nice, soft spoken and gentle"
The staff here is great. They were very helpful and accommodating. They were able to work my mother in and everyone was so friendly.
"Great, caring staff.  Very involved in helping me get better.  Willing to work with my schedule and my budget.  Would definitely recommend them."
Great staff! And I've seen marked improvement in only 3 weeks.
very unclean... very understaffed and will leave you for a 5 or more minutes at a time between your exercises...
BEST physical therapy place EVER
Great group of therapist.
"I had to physical therapy at a different facilities, I ended up quitting. Therapy is hard enough as it is.. at PT solution the experience has been great, employees seem to enjoy their  jobs.. most of all they KNOW what they are doing!"
Amanda is an amazing Therapist! She explains every exercise before and what it‚Äôs doing to and for my injury. She‚Äôs so knowledgeable! She is also compassionate and knows just how far to push when I‚Äôm in pain. It‚Äôs clear she really cares about her clients and wants what‚Äôs best for them.
I was really impressed with Nichelle on the front desk when I checked in. She was very nice and knew how to do her job efficiently.  I was also impressed with my therapist Meghan. She helped me with vertigo treatment and also made suggestions and gave instructions for balance work to be done at home. She was very effective and very friendly. It was an excellent experience and I highly recommend them.
Wonderful place and very friendly people. I had Megan as a physical therapist and I highly recommend her. I wish I would have been closer to my deductible because I can't continue going as of right now. I can definitely tell when I went it helped a lot. I would definitely recommend going here and letting them help you.
The staff is very friendly and make you feel comfortable.  The workouts are beneficial and they teach what to do at home to further the benefit.  Great folks!!!
I was a patient several years ago. I called them the day before I was leaving on a weeklong trip because I had tweaked my back. They were able to work me in that day and most importantly gave me a good bit of relief so that I could enjoy my vacation. They do an amazing job!!
"As an active adult, I am busy. You could describe me as constantly on the go. This came to a crashing halt when I fell off a washing machine as I was stepping to get back on a ladder. Luckily, the wall blocked my direct fall, and my injuries were back pain without broken bones. After 3 weeks of suffering with back pain, my doctor sent me to PT Solutions. There, Laura and Sarah compassionately helped me by easing the pain in my back and by designing an at home program to address the my physical needs. Visiting the office and my at home exercise program, was highly effective. I went from limited mobility to ‚Äúnormal‚Äùmobility in about 5 weeks. I appreciate so much, the care I received, as well as, how they were so knowledgeable. The office staff were great assisting with the ins and outs of insurance. Do not hesitate to use this group if you need assistance. It is well worth it."
"I have only had one appointment, I will say, first impressions are lasting impressions. From the first TELEPHONE encounter through my insurance ‚Äòchallenges‚Äô working with the ladies at the front to observing all the activity and interaction on the floor, I was impressed. I truly felt the team members that I interacted with were interested in my case (y‚Äôall know what I mean!!!). I‚Äôm  actually looking forward to my next appointment. 5 stars for sure."
Excellent and knowledgeable therapy in a professional and friendly environment - highly recommend!
I just started coming to PT Solutions in Acworth and have to say they are great. Sara works with me and is always concerned about how I am feeling and of any problems. Always explains what she is doing and the goal trying to be achieved. Would recommend them for any of your PT needs hands down.
"Quickly identified problems, then doable and effective solutions.  Facility has broad physical therapy plus aquatic (pool).  Entire staff is outstanding.  Thank you!"
"This is the best PT office I've been to, and I've been to a lot.

Everyone from the people at the reception desk to the PTs are courteous and extremely helpful. I had Nichole who helped me with my therapy and she ended up being amazing. My symptoms were always relieved after I saw her.

The assistants that helped me do my exercises were great as well. They were always patient and made sure I got whatever I needed.

The office itself is located in a business office center and has a modern interior. Overall very pleased with this location and Nichole, my PT."
"Not only did I find the Physical Therapists highly skilled and knowledgeable, but also very pleasant, empathic and sensitive to me and the other clients that were there.

In addition, the administrative staff presented calm and caring service at check-in and while scheduling further appointments.

Top Class in my opinion.

P.S. Yes, the therapy has helped reduce the pain I experience and increased mobility."
"Laura Vincent at PT Solutions has been of great help to me regarding injuries to my back. On two separate occasions, she has properly diagnosed my injury and provided me with excellent care. I highly recommend PT Solutions and Laura in particular."
"I came to PT Solutions with pain in my knee.  I was sent to PT after getting a steroid shot by my orthopedic doctor.  After the first visit I felt great improvement with mobility of the knee and had less pain.  By the third appointment I had little to no pain!  When I came to PT Solutions, they did a great assessment.  They helped me to immediately build up the necessary muscles to support the knee.   I would recommend them to anyone.  BTW, my wife and daughter have gone to them for other issues and have had great results too!"
"The clinical staff and receptionists are ""Outstanding!"" They are professional, efficient and courteous.    I have used the facility twice in 2017 and have been exceedingly pleased with the service and results of my therapy.   If considering a therapy facility I would highly recommend the staff at the Acworth location."
"Hi, My name is Ann an I have enjoyed PT Solution Physi√ßal Therapy from day one. The place is so very clean and well maintained. The workers are some of the best all around with knowing what to do, to try and get you feeling the best you can with all they have. I cannot say how lucky I feel to have found this place. The office I go to is the one in Acworth, Georgia. I am sure there is one close to most ever town. God bless the worker for being good at there job and caring all at the same time."
Several members of our family have been here for several different issues over the past 7 years and have all had very positive experiences. The therapists are very attentive to your condition and the deep rooted factors causing your pain. Very comprehensive care and focus on getting you better!
Always fill better after therapy. Smart therapy.
"PT Solutions has locations that are convenient and their staff is well trained.  They are prompt in servicing their clients and develop creative solutions to address their clients' issues.  In addition, they make their clients feel welcome and are energetic to address their clients' issues in the most expeditious manner."
"Jeanna is fantastic!   Provides tough love, encouragement and makes certain that you are using the right technique at all times!"
"Hands on care, just right. Extremely flexible in scheduling the care I need when I need it. Very knowledgeable Doctorate level people take top notch care of patients. And theythey up good at home programs to complement their office work."
"I have had physical therapy before, so I have something to compare my experience to. This office is fabulous. The front staff is friendly and efficient, and my physical therapist Kristen is incredibly caring and knowledgeable. This office has restored my faith in physical therapy again. THANK YOU."
A very knowledgeable and efficent staff with great bed side manor.
Treated me great was very patient.  I'm sorry I didn't complete my treatment the care was really getting me back to my old self
"During my first visit, I felt reassured that there would be an end to my heel pain. The therapist explained why the pain was manifested in the heal although it was coming from other places in my leg. The staff are friendly and confident."
"They have the best Physical Therapists you could ask for.  They are caring, professional, and they never give up on you. Would never go anywhere else."
Having worked with multiple physical therapists in my life I can say work with Tye and anyone who has trained under him is simply incredible.
"(TL;DR: summary at the bottom of my review)

As someone who has spent far too much time in Physical Therapy over the past 2.5 years, I'd like to think I'm a good judge of who is and isn't worth using. Acworth's PT Solutions is DEFINITELY an excellent choice. While I have remained friends with my previous PT from my home state of Louisiana and had little negative to say about that location, PT Solutions has kind of blown them out of the water.

I'd liken it to a well-oiled machine, I suppose, but that doesn't give you a sense of the warmth and friendliness of the staff. There is no shortage of employees waiting to guide you through the process, all of whom have been so pleasant and knowledgeable. Someone is always there to make sure you're doing an exercise properly and offer praise or correction as needed. It's very reassuring to know that my progress (and that of others) is being carefully monitored.

They know what the best exercises are for you to do, and explain why. For me, it's worth noting that they have me working both sides of my body, which was not previously done at my last PT's location. Not doing so creates an imbalance and has undoubtedly made my gimp-limp even worse over the years. When Isabela explained the reason for working both sides to me, my first thought was ""Why didn't my last PT in Louisiana know this?""

Most importantly, I'm rapidly progressing! As someone who hasn't had true progress in a very long time, this means the world to me. Mary and Amanda have 2.5 yrs of re-programming to undo, and they're unraveling it quickly. I'm so thankful to these two ladies!

It's also worth noting the cleanliness and organization of this facility. It's very large, bright, and clean. Everything has a place, so that no one is left trying to hunt for any specific tool. The abundance of said tools is also a plus. There is no ""we have to wait for so-and-so to finish with the ball"".

I've also had no issue in scheduling appointments with my two preferred PT's at the time of day that is most convenient for me. (The ladies at the front desk are also really nice!) Really, you cannot go wrong with choosing this facility to help get your body back on track!

TL;DR:

- Organized & clean facility
- Knowledgeable
- Friendly
- Professional
- Readily available personnel
- Easy to schedule appointments
- All around excellent choice

Google reviews are what helped me decide on PT Solutions, so I hope that my review has helped make your decision easier! :D"
"A caring, wonderful staff!  I highly recommend P.T. Solutions at Ivey Rd, particularly Laura!"
Awesome Staff and very professional and efficient!
Great care from Great people













I used Benchmark after my shoulder surgery two years ago and was happy with the results. So when I hurt my neck while on vacation I knew I needed PT to fix it not just take meds to cover up the pain. I chose Benchmark because I knew they did dry needling. It only took three weeks to become pain free.
"Benchmark in Newnan has excellent therapist's who provide the expertise required to solve the issue's
.  Very professional"
Every staff member is amazing! They‚Äôre efficient and focus on helping you to recover.  Office staff are always kind and work hard to make sure you have a positive experience. The only physical therapy place I would always recommend!!!
Had my knee replaced on May 18th and now walking 4 - 6 miles a day. Trust the therapy and definitely trust the Benchmark PT Team. Worked with Doc Padgett and was totally satisfied with how he structured my treatment plan. The office staff was very professional and accommodated my changing schedule through all of my visits. I highly recommend Benchmark  PT .
My experience with assigned staff has been positive and the work done on my shoulder has improved tremendously! I truly recommend this place for treatment!
i love it
"I would recommend therapy at Benchmark in Newnan because when I received therapy I had a great experience with my therapist Darcy Bassett she is great & I felt like a new person when I was discharged.  The staff is 100% invested in your rehabilitation, they show compassion for each individual & their therapy.  I would definitely return for any therapy I may need."
"My daughter went here for OT,  they did an amazing job. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, made it feel more like a family environment. Would definitely recommend Benchmark for all therapy needs."
Great place! Took care of all my needs and the staff was super nice and went above and beyond for me.. Thanks again!
The therapist Darcy did not apply her complete focus on my physical therapy she only had me doing exercises that was done at home . Darcy act like she didn't want to apply her hands on me with deep massage therapy . Just taking advantage of my insurance. Very unclean restroom  no one ever checked restroom
Great place!! Great staff!!






I cannot say enough great things about the staff of ATI in Dalton. They were very personable and knowledgeable. I can say with great certainty they changed my life. I came in with a pinched nerve from a back injury that was persistent for months. Jason assessed my injury and tailored my sessions flawlessly. I recommend this group to anyone seeking relief!!
"Jason in Dalton is very thorough and informative and has a great personality and so does Kelsey! I actually enjoy going to do my therapy. Other physical therapy places could only wish they had folks like Jason! Jason doesn‚Äôt just put you through the physical therapy, he explains the muscles, the physical therapy part of it etc. Lisa Bray"
I had a total knee replacement on the 8th of this month and have to go to therapy for the first time in my life. I did not know what to expect and was in a bit of pain the day of my first session (the day after my surgery). Jason was very patient with me and answered my questions of what was normal and what to be looking for. He was very easy with me that first day while still working me towards my goal. Every session since has been the same way. Jason and Emily have taken time to answer questions and address any concerns. I would highly recommend them to anyone I know that is needing therapy and will be back next when I get the other knee done.
I went to ATI for my 2nd hip replacement. I was not satisfied with the first therapy experience. My recovery here has been much faster and easier. They are more organized with an overall better recovery plan. I definitely made the right decision by switching to this place!
"ATI Staff are very friendly and you never have to wait on your therapist. Jason is my PT, he let‚Äôs me work at my comfort pace. He gives me encouragement and positive attitude. I know I have a way to go before I can walk without my cane. With each session he reminds me of my goals with a little more hard work.GREAT Place!"
Every time I go I feel like they really care and help me to steadily grow stronger!!
Therapist are very helpful and very kind and welcoming. The facility is always clean. They‚Äôve answered every question i had so im happy üòÉ
Today was my first day and it was a very positive experience. The staff is very friendly and courteous. Jason did a very good job of explaining everything to me. I appreciate knowing what the exercises prescribed are supposed to accomplish. I would highly recommend this facility.
It is a pleasant place to do my physical therapy!
Jason and his team are great. I wouldn't go anywhere else.
They are great.. They show concern in your recovery process. They care about you and do not push you to far so you won't further injure your injury... I love the better than Bradley wellness center
The physical therapy I am receiving from Jason at ATI has been wonderful! I can tell a difference in my low back pain since going to my therapy sessions. A new exercise to strengthen my core is added every week to give me the tools I need to get the relief I‚Äôve longed for my low back pain! I highly recommend ATI!!
"Everyone is professional, nice, and caring."
"The entire staff rocks!!! They are pleasant, friendly, fun, professional and well trained. They certainly know what they are doing!!!! I highly recommend. Jason and Eric are the BEST!"
The Staff is Very personable. I have enjoyed getting to know Jason and Aaron They're both very professional and knowledgable.I have had great results so far and would highly recommend ATI Physical Therapy in Dalton.
They are so nice and adjust to your needs. I love going to ATI !!! I always walk in with a smile and out with a smile. Thank you ATI !!!
"It is always fun and they are so nice and helpful thank to Jason and Eric for helping me.

"Dr. Bianca Tyler is one of the best physical therapists I‚Äôve had the pleasure of working with. She truly loves what she does and she is extremely skilled and knowledgeable with her expertise. Her bedside manner, ability to educate her patients on their health concerns, communication, and overall management of her clinic as a director make her stand out from many physical therapists I know (and as a person!). I highly recommend this Benchmark location."
"I had a great experience at the Benchmark PT in Lithia Springs. Bianca was great, knowledgeable, pleasant and always greeted me with a smile and bubbly attitude‚Ä¶.not to mention a great conversationalist. I went for Pelvic Function PT. She didn‚Äôt prolong or stretch out my PT time. I was done in littler over a month. The exercises she taught me have been a tremendous help. So thankful for her! I definitely recommend Benchmark in Lithia Springs for Pelvic Function therapy."
Bianca is amazing!! She got my pain under control and the staff is super nice!
Great Dr.  very knowledgeable & motivated. Get out what you put in.  Dr. will put you in positions to Win.
"I was referred to Benchmark for pelvic floor physical therapy.  My therapist Bianca was very helpful, knowledgeable and very kind and encouraging.  The staff was friendly and helpful also.  I highly recommend the Lithia Springs Benchmark.  I reached my goal with the great instruction of Bianca.  Thank you."
"Had to go to this Benchmark for pelvic floor physical therapy services and I'm not disappointed!! Not only did Bianca help me with the issue I came in for, she helped me with my back issues and now I am able to enjoy the things I want to do without the pain I had been in before!! Great people here with great attitudes and Bianca is the best!!! üòÉ"
"Very friendly, flexible scheduling, when I couldn't make the office visit, they scheduled me a virtual visit! They all are awesome!"
"I had an amazing experience at Benchmark Physical therapy in Lithia Springs, GA. The staff Jeanine, Bianca, Alex, and Lynette were very professional, knowledgeable, motivating and attentive. Jeanine contacted my Orthopedic Dr. and suggested  home equipment for me to use which resulted me making quicker and better progress in my recovery process. They are the best and highly recommended! I am forever indebted to them!"
I had a wonderful experience at Benchmark. Bianca was professional and so knowledgeable. . She helped me gain the confidence  I needed after surgery to get back to my life of activity. The facility is clean and the staff is efficient and friendly. I highly recommend their services!
"Very nice, very pleasant ,professional love the way the staff treated me.. Went to another location the staff was unprofessional. Thanks you Benchmark in Lithia Spring Thornton Roadüëçüëç"
"I had a great experience with Benchmark with my therapy. Alex was very professional, knowledgeable and helped me out. Definitely would recommend."
When I was referred to benchmark physical therapy I was very skeptical about whether it would help or not but after going through the treatment with Bianca I know that it has made a difference. It was an overall great experience.
I had an awesome experience at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Lithia Springs; they were very attentive and were the sweetest staff. It was bittersweet graduating but I will stop in occasionally to say hey. Highly recommended
"My experience at Benchmark in Lithia Springs was absolutely wonderful. I had some reservations at first as I was nervous and not sure what to expect. However, the entire staff-Bianca, Calvin, Kat & Jeanine were phenomenal! üòç They helped me feel better while remaining professional and friendly. I love how each staff member took pride in making sure everyone who walked through the door were not only taken care of but received a great experience. I highly recommend the Benchmark team in Lithia Springs for anyone seeking physical therapy treatment."
Janine and Sam are amazing Physical Therapists!! I came there tore up and in pain from Police Academy. They both made sure that I am moving at my best now. I am happy with my results as well as their customer service. Thanks guys! I will miss you
"My experience at Benchmark was incredible. The staff (Calvin,Bianca, Kat, and the Senior Therapist: Jeanine L. Burnell) was not only friendly, but extremely Professional. They were firm yet sensitive to my needs. I feel that the staff did not just come to work, they came to make you better. They make you feel like a part of their family. I wish that I could give more STARS.  **********"
Bianca is the best. I feel as though I have a normal life again.  I have come a long way.
This branch is awesome!!!! Great staff and very professional  with people who really cares about your recovery. I was here on work comp and I must say this was the first time I didn‚Äôt feel rushed to go back to work. They explain each exercise and how it‚Äôs going to help you. AWESOME!!!!!!!
This is the best physical therapy I have ever experienced! Super friendly and knowledgeable staff! Very helpful! I highly recommend Benchmark to anyone needing the best therapy solution for their recovery! THANK YOU!!!
I had a wonderful experience at this location. Everyone treated kindly and endeavored to provide me with the best possible care. I would highly recommend this location to anyone looking for a physical therapist.
"The doctors are great and I fill at home and everyone is so nice , the best place to recover"
I could not have went to a better physical therapy center! They made me back to my original 100% after my car accident and God forbid if it happened again I‚Äôd wouldn‚Äôt dare go anywhere else.




I have had some issues for years that were diagnosed incorrectly by doctors. Natasha knew exactly what to do by using trigger point and physical therapies. I am able to do things physically without pain like I haven't been able to in years.
Great place. Everyone of the Drs were friendly and made you feel extremely comfortable. They work with you as an individual and Taylor the therapy to you not just a cardboard cut out of things to do. I have to say I was most impressed with Dr Padgett. He was extremely knowledgeable about everything and never made me push myself to get back normal he gave me all the time i needed all while reassuring me and giving me all the tools i needed to recover! I loved this place and if (knock on wood) anything ever happens again I would only choose this place to go! Thanks for everything Doc and listening to me ramble while we worked!!!
My PT was Natasha and she is the sweetest ever.  Although PT is HARD- the atmosphere was so pleasant that you just wanted to come in and do it.  I have had therapy at Southern Therapy and I felt like I was just a number- here I felt like I was part of a family.  The Ladies are AWESOME and Natasha ROCKS!
"Benchmark is awesome! My therapist,  Natasha,  was so  knowledgeable and understanding,. She put me at ease from the first visit and provided great support throughout my weeks of therapy.  The results were much better than I ever imaged. The office staff was great too...efficient and friendly. Appointments were easy to make and therapy began on time...pretty much no waitng at all. I recommend Benchmark for any type of PT, but if you use them for pelvic floor therapy,  I feel sure you will feel comfortable and will be given the very best guidance possible as you deal with your situation.  Highly recommend!!!"
"Hands down the best care/staff of any PT facility I have used. Your best chance of being on both legs, pain free, and with a smile on your face, is at BenchMark PT in Carrollton, GA."
"Excellent staff , very friendly and very knowledgeable in therapy and your pacific needs.If you do what they say you will get better. I recommend them highly for your therapy"
Absolutely the best ‚Äúmedical‚Äù type of establishment I‚Äôve been too. I‚Äôve NEVER felt comfortable in any medical establishment always nervous! Not at Benchmark in Carrollton though. The best part is not only the relief that the staff provides. The best part is the staff PERIOD! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
"The Therapists are very friendly and caring about your health issue. They are very knowledgeable about what therapy is needed to make a person's body stronger. They all have a sense of humor and keep things lighthearted during each session, which helps when the healing process is sometimes intense. I highly recommend this place for body strengthening therapy."
"This is an awesome PT staff. They are very  kind and understanding. I don't know what I would have done without their help and excellent treatment. I would refer anyone to them! Thanks again to Kris, and Natasha for getting me back to being myself!"
"Excellent staff at Carrollton Benchmark PT!!  Wanted to thank Kris, Morgan, Natasha and Steve for getting me back on track from L6 lumbar fusion surgery several years ago due to my neglecting physical rehab.  The professionalism, therapy methods, attention to detail and concern for their patients was remarkable.  Highly recommend this facility!!"


"This location had everything that I needed from PT.  The team here is responsive, adaptive, and cohesive.  They did a very good job of building relationships with clients that put you in a position of comfort to be able to trust them and be successful.  They also were able to assist with any client issues regularly, quickly and with high quality.  If you were struggling with something, they remained positive and encouraging while differentiating exercises for your needs and embracing a growth mindset.  While I mostly worked with Jamie and JT, I also worked with Austin and Christine.  They all worked well together and provided enough information to see no gap when I moved from one therapist to another.  I am happy for all of the work they did to help me get to a pain free place while building the tools to continue my self-care."
"Top notch professionals.  They listen, give you honest input and feedback, and push you in a positive way to improve within your own capabilities.  They are personable and truly care about getting you well.  This is the second time I've used Benchmark, and wouldn't go anywhere else."
"The Team at Benchmark is second to none.  I had services in OT and PT at the same time.  They were very accommodating in scheduling my appts back to back.  From the front office staff to the therapist to the assistants, everyone is helpful and friendly.  The therapists are knowledgeable, experienced and truly want the best outcome for each patient.  They are willing to fully answer any question and give helpful tips on how to best manage pain.  They are wonderful!!"
"I was recommended to go to benchmark physical therapy by my 98-year-old aunt and my wife, who both absolutely loved this place.

I had a pretty severe shoulder injury where I could not even put my arm in my coat. A couple of months later and with a lot of care and direction from my main therapists Christina and intern Julia and others, I‚Äôm back in business and able and to tackle my everyday activities again with no surgery!

I absolutely loved coming to my therapy sessions.  Even during the pandemic, there was such a friendly uplifting environment at Benchmark the challenging sessions were the highlight of my day!  Even today on my last day, they are still sanitizing every piece of equipment constantly, so you can be confident this is a clean environment. I will miss coming to my sessions and appreciate the time they all spent with me, from the friendliest front desk ever, to the best physical therapists ever I will miss you guys! Keep up the great work you are doing to keep people healthy and moving!"
They scheduled me for the wrong location even though I asked the person specifically about the location . I needed a physical therapy close to my place waited one week fir the appointment and didn‚Äôt go to work not knowing that the location is wrong. Nobody really cared ! Going back to St. Joseph Hospital. They have the best customer service and care!
Christina is A+. She understands muscle problems and makes every possible attempt to rehab an athletic injury. Her emotional support and gradient of exercises helped me to recover significant strength from a severe ‚Äúover use‚Äù injury. I highly recommend her and BenchMark PT.
"I came into this clinic with extreme pain from a car accident. Jamie prepared an amazing plan for me to get better and take home exercises. Today I‚Äôm pain free and met my goals in therapy thanks to Jamie and her team. The staff is welcoming, friendly and very knowledgeable. I would recommend anyone in need of therapy services to attend Benchmark on Glenridge."
Awesome experience Christina and everyone there are super welcome and helpful. Would recommend
"I never imagined how wonderful physical therapy could be!! A huge THANK YOU to my therapist, Christina, for not only being amazingly knowledgeable and talented, but she was also a true cheerleader who inspired me to stay motivated and determined to heal at a great pace.  I also express gratitude to Jamie, Ashley and Jessica. Such an awesome team, as their group chemistry is so contagious...you will not be disappointed with their care and service!! --Teneshia"
"Just finished my PT and I am actually sad to not see the fantastic people that work here every week. Thank you to Christina, my therapist, Liz, Jamie, Drew And Alex for making this such a fun and pleasant place to go for a physical therapy. Christina is very knowledgeable and was instrumental to the improvement of my shoulder. It was very painful when I started, but through the right massage for  my shoulder, along with  the exercises I did for strengthening the muscles around my shoulder, I am so much better! I no longer have the daily pain that I started with and have much more mobility in that shoulder.  I cannot say enough good things about the staff.  Great place to go & get results!"
"Even before therapy had begun, I have to give this clinic a 5 star review. The administration is everything you want in a healthcare provider and more. Alex at the front desk is warm, personable, smart, and efficient. He contacted my doctor for a referral and had paperwork prepared for me when I arrived. Thanks, Alex, for making me feel so comfortable. P. S. The space is clean, spacious, and well-equipped with an awesome sound system."
Christina and the staff are amazing and intuitive to what the patient needs. Also super friendly from when you arrive and through the whole process.
What a fabulous place to rehab your mind body and spirit! The feeling generated in the whole clinic is outstanding. Jamie was a fantastic therapist and along with everyone else there ( Elizabeth Christina Alexa and Alex) the place runs like a well oiled machine.
"I had a torn rotator cuff and bicep. From day one everyone working there explained the recovery process and encouraged me all the way to complete recovery..it's hard work, but there were some fun moments between staff and all clients..I'm glad I chose this location because I can't give enough praise for their professionalism..thank you Benchmark.."
"Jamie Fisher is everything a physical therapist should be!!! She is knowledgeable, personable, and just everything a patient would need. I was her patient for some time and I loved every session. She always asked how I was feeling and really cared for my needs.

Also, another therapist would help from time to time and her name is Liz. She is also amazing and very hands on. The receptionist Alex is also very personable and makes you feel welcomed!

Overall, Jamie made my physical therapy experience a great one! 5 star location!!! ‚ú®

Thank You!"
"This is my 2nd time going through PT at Benchmark (Atlanta drivers are crazy on the road), but my first time at the Glenridge location. I must say that with my hectic schedule and immense pains throughout my body, Benchmark has been very welcoming with helping me to get back to functioning order, and I‚Äôd like to especially thank Ms. Ashlynn for always checking on me whenever I was running late, Ms. Jamie and Ms. Christina, 2 wonderful PTs who did an amazing job at healing my aches and pains, and of course Ms. Liz, an awesome Tech who always checked on me and made sure I was doing well every time I came in. These 4 ladies have been an immense help, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the results of Physical Therapy. Thank you so much for all of your help, and thank you for making every visit fun and joyful :)"
"Wonderful place, knowledgeable therapists and very welcoming. I had therapy there for 4 month: first for my hand and arm with Ashleen who was so helpful and friendly, second- with Jamie and Cristina . I received the best care from them, as well.
I should say that it felt like visiting  my friends.
I don‚Äôt want to forget Alex and Liz-thank you guys.
Great experience !"
"I had a complete right knee replacement on Wed, Dec 9th.  I was told to use a home care service for the first few weeks then go to a facility for Physical Therapy.  I decided against this and the day after my operation I had my first appointment with Benchmark Sandy Springs.  Jamie was my therapist and she was wonderful.  She was so good that I was walking badly but walking with a cane after 3 sessions.  On Saturday Dec 26th I actually drove a car for the first time - remember it was my right knee.  By mid February my doctor stated that I no longer needed Therapy and I have been fine since.  Jamie and Benchmark are highly recommended by me.  I would also say that if you are scared of home care, not self motivated, do not have the space, etc. then going to Benchmark immediately forme was the right thing to do!!"
Benchmark Physical Therapy is a fabulous place.  I have personally worked with Christina and Ashlynn.  Both therapists helped me to reach all of my goals.  I was extremely pleased with my results.  The rest of the staff are wonderful.  I would highly recommend Benchmark  Physical Therapy on Johnson Ferry Rd .
"Saying this PT clinic is "" the best"", belittles what the clinic truly is. I honestly loved coming here. I can't find the right words to explain how grateful I am to have come here. All the therapists and front desk staff are beyond great! Although I only worked with Ashlynn & Eryn( both the coolest OTs) , the other staff would give me positive remarks on how well I was progressing. Apart from receiving therapy, you receive a lot of friendly talk.Also their music taste is truly pleasing.

Ashlynn, whom is the therapist I worked with the most, is a remarkable person. She helped me set goals to improve my strength in which we would both tackle after continuously working on them. Our motto "" Get swole""

I would definitely be back at this clinic if I were to injure my other hand
I recommend this clinic, the treatment you'll receive is outstanding!

The only sad part is saying goodbyes when getting discharged."
"I give Benchmark at Sandy Spring the highest rating. They have a huge facility, and have a very friendly staff who are well trained and very professional. They give you photo handouts of the exercises and a link to view them on video at home as well. I keep going back to them as needed. Furthermore, they are within a few blocks of Resurgens, Northside Hospital, and St. Joseph‚Äôs Hospital, with almost immediate access to GA 400, I-75, and I-285. I recommend them to you and highly suggest that you give them a try!"
"I just graduated today from weeks of PT with Jamie after knee replacement surgery! So glad she helped me to recuperate well and give lots of tips to help with my recovery! This place is very friendly and professional. Jamie was great and I would recommend this place to anyone! In fact, this is my second knee replacement in which I went to them!!"
"Christina is the best physical therapist and a wizard with her hands. She is absolutely amazing and I would recommend her to anyone and everyone. Before I was lucky enough to find Christina, I was in constant pain. After my first visit with her, I noticed a huge difference! She helped me gradually regain my strength and range of motion with her amazing dry needling techniques and personalized stretches and exercises. I had the pleasure of working with Teresa and Jamie who were also amazing Physical Therapists. I also worked with Rik, the BEST Athletic trainer, a few times on personalized strength regaining exercises that were tailored to my injury. Overall, the entire staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable!"
I am thankful for being able to have the BEST physical therapist named JAMIE FISHER at Benchmark Physical Therapy Glenridge. Jamie goes above and beyond her call of duty. She is a dedicated and a caring PT. She is highly knowledgeable in her job and has done everything possible in helping me deal with my condition. I appreciate her for trying to find every avenue to best suit my situation and to lead me in the right direction.
"Loved getting physical therapy here, everyone is fantastic!!"
I love this place. My favorites are Raakhee and Christina.
Jamie Fisher is the absolute best physical therapist! She identified all of the problems and individually designed a physical therapy protocol that was tailed for me. I am pain free and have incredible mobility now. Thank you thank you Jamie. Also the entire staff at Benchmark is so wonderfully helpful and friendly.
Great place and friendly staff! Thanks for the professionalism and speedy recovery.
"I‚Äôve been going to this location location on and off for 1.5yrs. The team members have always been pleasant, caring & welcoming; always determined to see you succeed. Thank you Jamie, Michelle & Christina for motivating & pushing me to achieve new limits. I will forever be grateful to you!"
"The staff at Benchmark was extremely knowledgeable, and very friendly. My sessions for vestibular therapy were very thorough, and I felt a difference after just a few visits. I would recommend this team to anyone with PT needs!"
"The staff is wonderful. From checking in, to the Techs and the Therapists, everyone is caring and helpful. A winning combo when you come in not feeling your best, in my case with knee issues. I love the progress I have made and will keep coming here to continue my journey to stronger knees. Great place!"
"I would definitely recommended this location. The staff is very friendly and everyone is committed to your journey to recovery. Jaime and Christina were the two Physical Therapists I dealt with most, but all of the PTs would check on me and my progress at Benchmark. I also had the pleasure of working with Johnathan, a graduate student who is pursuing a career in Physical Therapy. Everyone has wonderful bedside manner and the energy makes me more motivated to do the exercises. 10/5 stars!"
"I went to Benchmark Physical therapy after I was involved in a dog attack.  The attack resulted in a fractured wrist and concussion. My neck constantly hurt, as well as daily headaches, lower and upper back pain and painful movement when using my wrist.  Jamie and Alex treated me and were completely awesome and informative about my injuries. They taught me exercises and stretches I can do at home as well as they got me feeling so much better. I highly recommend Bench Mark Physical Therapy and truly believe they have an amazing team of highly trained Physical Therapist."
Excellent help with reducing R shoulder tendinitis. Caring and thorough. Effective team work
"Excellent place! Highly Recommend the Johnson Ferry Rd Location. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. They do an amazing job in making you feel comfortable and making sure your needs are being attended. I came in with horrible pain, and I did no think it could possibly improve. I am now half way in my treatment and I am already feeling significant improvement,  my pain level has decreased making a huge impact in my ability to do my daily routine easier and pain free."
Christina Chan-Pong was great.
"A very good facility with great staff. Friendly, considerate and punctual. I worked mostly with Riaz and cant thank him enough for the way he helped me manage my injury. Will strongly recommend this facilty."
Great staff - very attentive and friendly.  Can't recommend them enough!  My neck and shoulder pain is gone because of their care. Highly recommend!
Great experience with very friendly and knowledgeable PTs!
Very knowledgeable and helpful staff! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for anymore more.
"I have been going to this place for a couple months now, due to knee and lower back injuries that were caused by a car wreck a few months ago. Went to Chiro for 6+ months prior to coming here, and that only helped me with my upper back pain. No-one could heal my knee and lower back, which was having me worry that I have to live with the pain forever.

I was prescribed PT by my ortho. I honestly regret not coming here earlier. I wish I could take back all those (semi-useless) chiro sessions, especially since back then I was in grad school and SUPER busy.

BenchMark Physical Therapy has been nothing but amazing to me. The staff are all wonderfully nice. I have yet to have an issue with any one of them. They all work as a team to make sure their clients are receiving the best treatment possible.

The treatments that I have been receiving by my DPT (Ms. Shanoon) include stretches, strengthening exercises, walking, dry needling, and cupping. They have worked wonders, as my knee and back pain are now both gone. Ms. Shannon is an absolutely wonderful, patient, and understating person, as are and her assistants Patrick and Brandon.

Overall, I think this place is superb. I recommend BenchMark at Glenridge to everyone!"
"Benchmark PT on Johnson Ferry Rd. Dunwoody, Ga. Is excellent the Dr.of Physical Therapy are the best. They follow the Doctors orders and know exactly how to take care of the patient. My Doctor of Physical Therapy is 'Highly Qualified and Very Competent' . Her name is Katie and is director of this Benchmark Branch. Katie treats me with utmost respect and loving care. She knows just how to handle my difficulties. I feel very grateful that Katie is so knowledgable.

I have watched all the DPT's and others working in this Benchmark branch. I have noticed that ALL of them are extremely qualified. The patients.appear to be very satisfied with their care and progress. I feel the same way.The Administrative Staff, who make appointments and greet patients I will say are well trained. It is a joy to go into a Benchmark on Johnson Ferry Rd.

I feel welcomed and know that I will be well taken care of no matter who would be my DPT."
"Best physical Therapy I got  both at Glenridge and in Brookehaven locations . On time, efficient, flexible and knowladgeable. Got exercizes that I was never recommended before. Glenridge location hasa parking issue especially around lunch time"
Super friendly staff







"I can‚Äôt say enough great things about this staff. I was a patient at the Woodstock Eagle drive location.  Many of the staff rotate to the other locations. They are friendly, knowledgeable  and have your best interest at heart. I‚Äôve worked with them over the last 3+ months. I wish my podiatrist had recommended PT years ago. Though I‚Äôve graduated from PT I know in the future if I ever need anything I can return. Before leaving Dr Amar Patel and Luke discussed a plan of action with me to continue at home. Don‚Äôt let PT be the last thing you try, let it be the first. This is a great group! They make the sessions feel less like work.

Amanda S Collins"
"I absolutely love the staff, they‚Äôre extremely supportive and really help you through whatever‚Äôs your needs may be"
They are the best. They are helping me a lot.
Fantastic service! Always feel at least a little better when I leave here after sessions
"I have been well pleased with the care I have received.  The staff is professional, very attentive and competent.  The atmosphere is friendly with just the right amount of encouragement and push to help me meet my goal.  I've been at another PT practice in Woodstock with my husband and thought they were good, but PT Solutions is far superior.  I highly recommend their service."
Great place and environment to get your rehab done and they help you stay on track the whole way.
Our experience with the Woodstock location has been fantastic for our seven year old.  They have been extremely patient with him.
PT Solutions has made quite a difference in eliminating my neck and low back pain.i am very satisfied with my treatment.
"Fabulous staff, from office to practioners, that take care of patients with professionalism and compassion. Top notch...highly recommend"
"my doctor recommended PT Solutions. Dr. Brockville and staff are professional and caring, and always give you a good workout."
"Greatttt, my daughter's therapist Emily
Is really good"


















"This place is AMAZING!! I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm spelling her name wrong & I apologize but Mishaw is a Beast & in a good way! When I 1st came to this place after 2 spinal surgeries in 2018 & 2019, I was not able to stand for longer than 10 minutes, sit longer than 30, nor lay on my sides for longer than 5 minutes. After LISTENING to my concerns, she came up w/ a great plan for getting me back on track. She then gave me information on ‚Äúdry needling‚Äù and I decided to take the next step. As skeptical as I was, I‚Äôm forever grateful for this process. After my 1st session I couldn‚Äôt believe how great I felt. It didn‚Äôt hurt at all. After about 2-3 more sessions, and we loosened up scarred tissue & muscles; I have more mobility than I have in the last 4 years! I‚Äôve recently started working with Tony! He‚Äôs just as great. He listens, he‚Äôs compassionate & his plan is working great too! I still have a long ways to go, but with this team; I‚Äôm very confident in my recovery journey. These therapists are not only skilled in their fields, they have great bedside manners, they listen, they care & you can feel it‚Äôs genuine! I would recommend this place to anyone who needs therapy. I am one appreciative patient!"
"The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Mishal is exceptional .  She is friendly and goes out of her way to tell you what to do , then show you how to do it right and is very patient and understanding . I had a left hip replacement and I feel that the therapy was beneficial and helped me so much.  She even told me what exercises I should do at home once my therapy sessions were finished .  I highly recommend this facility .
."
My 88 yr old mother sustained significant traumatic injuries after being hit by a car. After surgery we sought PT at Benchmark in Locust Grove GA purely by convenience. The staff is very helpful and friendly but Ariel (PT) is an awesome therapist! Mom came in by wheelchair and could barely lift herself out of the seat but after 7 weeks at 2 sessions per week with Ariel she has resumed her independence including driving herself! Thanks for giving my mom back her life.
Sheree is the best PT ever. I was so afraid I was going to be in pain when leaving after therapy however it was the best I‚Äôve felt since the accident. Thank you so much Sheree
"Sad that the person who gave this place one star did not comment on a reason.  This place is amazing.  The therapists know to start slowly and when to move to a higher level.  They are friendly and almost make my time here enjoyable.  I have progressed much faster than expected, and give them all the credit.   Don't let that one negative person keep you from going here."
"""KC"" the physical therapist did an amazing job correcting my BPPV.  I had symptoms for several years but one visit with her and I am no longer dizzy.  I will be recommending Benchmark to anyone needing help with BPPV."
"I can not thank Detra enough for her dedication and support that she gave me while dealing with the ups and downs of having had a hip replacement.  The recovery was by far one of the most challenging issues that I have had to overcome.  From the moment I entered into Benchmark, she welcomed me in and assisted me non-stop with my rehabilitation.  Each day she welcomed me with a smile and a beautiful voice as she'd join in with me in singing tunes to soft melodies that were softly heard in the location.  The atmosphere was very welcoming and I have absolutely no complaints about my experience.  Detra always pushed me to do better and never gave me a feeling that my health was not in her best interest.  I dedicated 12 weeks of my therapy to Detra and Benchmark, never missed an appointment and was always on time.  When my therapy concluded, Detra advised me that I would always be welcome to return if things declined or if I needed direction on how to continue my therapy at home.  I strongly urge anyone that if you are dealing with any type of body ailment, visit Benchmark (locust Grove) and ask for Detra or any of the other amazing therapist on hand.  The front end of the office was also refreshing, always presented a smile upon entering and/or exiting.  I can conclude by saying that the progression of my ability to walk again was definately contributed to Detra, can not thank her enough.  Thank you!"

"I was fortunate to have Allison as my physical therapist. I could barely walk when I started and at the end I was back at Orange Theory which was my goal. She patiently answered all my questions and was attentive. And was fun to engage with.
Every staff person was friendly and helpful. I would return in a heartbeat and I‚Äôm sure there will be another need for PT as I‚Äôm no ‚ÄúSpring Chicken‚Äù"
"ALLISON WORKED WITH ME AND LOOSEN MY TIGHT HIP UP. SHE Was patient and knowledgeable. She gave me helpful exercises to do at home..boy, i sure hope I will do them."
Incredible therapist experience.  My pain improved greatly in a short amount of time.  The entire staff is very friendly and welcoming and they also take great care in cleanliness.  Would definitely go back for any therapy needs.
"Dana, Emily, and Becky are incredible! Emily and Dana are incredibly talented therapists, and are very experienced with all issues orthopedic and in pelvic health. Cannot recommend enough!"
"I feel like I went on a journey with Allison O'Halloran. I had reverse shoulder replacement surgery & she helped me thru some days, weeks & months of tough times. The entire staff is great & fun. I actually looked forward to my PT with Allison - it wasn't just about physical therapy. Surgery & PT is also about mental & emotional state of mind. Thank you Allison & BenchMark!!"
Alex and the team were able to accommodate me and my hectic schedule  as well as help me feel a million times better! The exercise selections were customized to my preference and were very effective in reducing my pain and most importantly the knowledge Alex provided me with will help me to prevent flare ups and manage the problem! Staff was professional and friendly!
Went in for a hip injury and had a great experience. All the staff was helpful and kind. I saw progress from their treatment and would recommend to anyone.
"I had a great experience doing my physical therapy after total knee replacement at this BenchMark facility. Clinic Director Alex Garrido has a calming manner, is exceptionally knowledgeable, and won‚Äôt push you to do more than you can tolerate. While I was there, he had a temporary Emory intern working with him named Kaitlyn who was awesome as well. Super nice person and very good with the patients.  Kyle was another staff member who assisted Alex with my exercises and was a pleasure. The Covid-19 precautions that they are taking at this facility are excellent from taking temperatures at the door, frequent hand washing, hand sanitizers throughout, and total sanitary scrub downs of all tables and equipment after each use. There are numerous BenchMark locations to choose from, but I highly recommend this Smyrna/Vinings facility."
"Had an appointment scheduled out a week and a half, then got a call the day before (at 3:47 and they close at 4)saying it wasn‚Äôt covered by my insurance. Called my insurance and resolved it, and left a message saying everything was fine. Called the next day at 830 and apparently they decided to cancel my appointment and not tell me! Now I have to wait a few more weeks to get into somewhere. Can‚Äôt say anything about the actual pt, but the front of house people definitely screwed me"
"I am a first-time customer who picked this location for therapy because of the reviews my doctor has received and also the distance from home. I have unfortunately had many surgeries that led to intensive physical therapy session's with other companies. I have finally found the company that has taken personal goals into account. I came in with 2 glenoid bone chips, one was lodged into my shoulder which caused part of my upper bicep muscle to be removed while the other chip ripped through my rotator cuff and labrum that caused me to get 5 screws put in my shoulder. I played collegiate sports and am still active in coaching with my day to day operations. My recovery time was skeptical due to the seriousness and the oddness of the the injury. I was given 6-8 months of physical therapy of recovery to full mobility, not strength by my doctor. Alex, one of the physical therapist's put me through a physical therapy program that put me in line for me to get to full mobility in 3 months! My personal goals were met way before the anticipated dates. I have full mobility and am doing strengthening exercises provided by Alex and the rest of the staff. If you go here your goals will be met, but your expectation's will be exceeded. I highly recommend this branch and highly recommend this staff of physical therapist...."
Jennifer Cazeaux is the best!


"Kimberly C Thomas is the best!!! She was so helpful in getting my hip and groin pain resolved after a hard fall.  She is so sweet and compassionate and lets you take all the time you need.   Please if you have a need for therapy go to Bench Mark Therapy  Jefferson, Ga office . You will be glad you did."
Staff were friendly and professional. Work was hard but effective. Thanks!
I highly recommend this Benchmark location to everyone who needs physical or occupational therapy. I have been going here for years and I have always had great results and the therapists and receptionists that work here are wonderful!  I just finished up with occupational therapy on my arm and I can‚Äôt say enough nice things about Heather and Chris! They were a tremendous help to me and I‚Äôm back to doing my everyday things! I‚Äôve also had Gracie as my therapist and also had great results with her too! Everyone that I have personally seen at this location has been exceptionally nice to me! Hope and Brittany also do a really good job with scheduling and answering the phone at the front desk and are super sweet!
"The Jefferson Benchmark office is top notch! I was prescribed PT due to a car accident and I have to say this office really knows how to treat patients with compassion. The staff create an inviting environment for you to be cared for no matter what your treatment needs are. I was impressed with the quality of all the PT staff. However, I did find someone that really knew how to treat me best...Gracie Aaron...she is a gem!! She cared for me so well, made me feel comfortable and helped me get back to how I was before my accident. I can't thank her and the team enough for all their help."
Benchmark Physical Therapy - Jefferson is awesome! They have such a fun team of therapists and everyone is just so nice! I personally was seen by Zach and couldn‚Äôt have received better care from anyone else! He was so attentive to things I told him about my back pain and also to the fact I was pregnant. He has such a big heart and just truly cares and wants each patient walking through the doors to feel better! Their whole office feels this way but especially the ladies at the desk! Hope and Britani are the sweetest ladies and they are always busy with helping patients answer questions about their insurance or scheduling their future visits. They may not be therapists but they do anything they can to make sure patients come in and leave with a smile on their face! Hope have me the breakdown of costs and how my insurance worked and made it so easy to understand! I know I can go to her with any questions I have and I will get an answer made super simple and easy for me understand. This entire clinic has such a family environment and I wouldn‚Äôt want to go anywhere else for my physical therapy needs!
Great place for Physical Therapy. People are very wonderful and very pleasant. I would recommend it to everyone. The staff really make you feel like they really are concerned about your needs and are willing to help you get better. I LOVE BENCHMARK .
"My 92 year old father recently had a heart attack and a stroke and was hospitalized for one week.  After getting out of the hospital the doctor referred my father for Physical Therapy to help him in his recovery.

My husband had several experiences with Benchmark PT Jefferson,
Georgia and recommended them highly so I scheduled my dad there for therapy.  I must say that my dad's experiences there were beyond my expectations.  He has been going there for the past several weeks and his  recovery has been remarkable.  I am very grateful for the extremely courteous and professional treatment  that he has received at Benchmark PT Jefferson.  All of the staff are very kind and patient."
I tore my ACL after a volleyball injury and I was going to Benchmark for my rehab. The staff there are very supportive and willing to do whatever they can to help people reach their full potential. After going here for my physical therapy I was able to go back to playing volleyball and reach my goal of playing at the college level. I would highly recommend this clinic for anybody who has any physical therapy needs.
"I was a patient Benchmark in Jefferson for about 7 months post ankle surgery. They were always so warm, friendly, & welcoming! They keep it fun & entertaining for their patients. Gracie is an angel! She was my PT & I always looked forward to seeing her every week. I would suggest this place, and Gracie to ANYONE!"
"Over the past two years I have had the need and pleasure of using Benchmark PT Jefferson four times!  First, it was due to hand surgery and intensive Occupational Therapy to regain control of my thumb and fingers. Second, after a bad fall and a broken wrist, I was treated again by the Occupational Therapist.

My left shoulder was surgically replaced last year and needed very intensive rehabilitation by one of their great Physical Therapists. Lastly. my personal physician prescribed a regiment of leg and back strengthening due to my repeated problems with falling.    Again, the Physical Therapists at Benchmark PT Jefferson did a great job helping me to build up my strength and balance.

I have intentional left out all the personal names of the  therapists who helped me with my recoveries because of my fear of forgetting somebody.  All the therapists and staff at the Jefferson Benchmark are extremely friendly, courteous, and absolutely professional.  I recommend them 100%."
"I spent nine weeks at the Jefferson location for an internship for PT school. I cannot think of better clinicians to have learned from. I admire the way they interacted with each patient, the way they individualized goals and treatment sessions to each person and the way they genuinely cared for their patients. Anyone will be lucky to be part of the Benchmark team and patient caseload"
I highly recommend BenchMark PT in Jefferson. I went twice a week for about 4 months for my back. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel at home. Gracie is AWESOME!! She helped me so much with my PT.
"Wonderful Place, went through 2 knee surgerys. I came out there feeling great. Love the people have built good relationships with them. Very caring"
Absolutely a delightful crew in Jefferson! Each of them know their stuff and they all helped me to get where I‚Äôm at today! The only complaint I have is that I graduated and no longer need their services!! If I ever need PT again I Definitely will be going here!! THANKS YALL SO MUCH!! ü§©üôèüèªüëçüòÖüèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíÉüèºüí™ü¶∂
BenchMark Jefferson is second to none!  I recently was treated for a running injury and came away extremely impressed.  The knowledge and care is unmatched.  Great work BenchMark Jefferson!!!
"I have had several experiences at Benchmark physical therapy in Jefferson.
Billing has never been a problem and their whole staff is great.
Grace is exceptionally knowledgeable and helped me with several injuries. I would recommend them very highly."
"We are extremely happy with the level of service provided by Gracie. She was professional, friendly and made my daughter feel very comfortable. Gracie has a very caring nature, is very knowledgeable,and has the ability to listen to her patients. We would highly recommend this physical therapy clinic."
I want to thank everyone at  Benchmark in the Jefferson location for there hard work and dedicationüëç. As I recover  from rotator cuff and bicep tear surgery. Thank you for making me feel like part of the family üòÅ. Awesome job .
"After a right shoulder reconstruction I was prescribed physical therapy. I had suffered well over a year with shoulder pain, so I certainly didn't want to take any chances in not healing properly. However, anyone thats been in my shoes understands my being nervous in starting PT. With that in mind, I will and have recommended Benchmark, Jefferson to family, friends, strangers, etc...
They are AWESOME!  Kind, patient, understanding, and thats only a few of the words that comes to my mind, but there's not time nor space here to say ALL the great things I could.
Thank you, all the therapists and staff. You are truely amazing,
Sherry Arnold"
"Zach, Heather and everyone are great even when I‚Äôm having my bad days...  A great place for PT and OT...  Wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else..."
"I have been using this location since they have opened up. Zac , Heather, Gracie , Hope , Brittany, and everyone else that has helped me have been great üëçüëç I always recommend The Jefferson Location to all my friends and to my Doctors for my P.T. !!!!!!!! They are great people!!!!!!!üëçüëç"
Benchmark you're the best physical therapy I've had so far thank you for all your hard work and dedication on getting me better
"good clinic, great people.  won't find a better place for your PT needs."
Benchmark was great for my daughter who has issues with TMJ. They used dry needling to relieve pain and tense muscles. They are excellent at what they do!
Best physical therapy clinic you‚Äôll find
Wonderful place.  They really care for you.
Great place to get well and back to life!

"I highly recommend. John Michael and the PT Solutions staff are friendly, fun, and most importantly knowledgeable. He helped me with all aspects of my recovery post transplant surgery. When I first started, I was using a walker and required assistance for simple daily task. 1-2 months later I was independent in completing daily task, and participating in activities I enjoy such as running, hiking, biking, golfing and swimming."
"My experience here has been phenomenal!!! I‚Äôm a student-athlete who suffered a season-ending,knee-injury and  each day I was pushed to my best potential on my road to recovery.every visit was something different and I loved it. I appreciate everyone in this facility who helped me during this process. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ( Honorable mentions ;John Micheal, Caleb, and Sydney) Hope to see you all again under better circumstances :)"
Highly recommend. John Michael and the team of trainees are outstanding. They‚Äôre the reason my jaw pain has decreased significantly. You will have an outstanding experience.
"I came to PT Solutions with severe neck, shoulder and arm pain. John is a great therapist and has helped me a lot. I'm very appreciative for all the knowledge that John Michael has given me to help continuing to get my neck and shoulder better."
John Michael is a wonderful therapist! He makes your recovery process fun and takes your mind off of the pain. No pain no gain. !
I just moved to the area and happened to come across PT Solutions- Emory Point. The facility is great and organized and John is awesome. I highly recommend this place if you are in need of a PT for any issue.
Fantastic facility and service. John Michael does great work. Highly recommend
John Michael has done an excellent job getting my back into working order again.
Russell is a great PT.  I ruptured my Achilles tendon and he helped me go from immobile to running and jumping around.  Never thought I would be back to playing tennis.  Thank you Russell.
"Great clinic, working with Russell is easy and motivating. There is quality care here."

"PT Solutions has a great staff who care about getting you back to your activities. From the front desk to the physical therapists, they are patient in answering all your questions. I spent most of my time with Caitlin and she challenged me and built my confidence up to where I trust my body to be active again. She listened to me and attended to all of my needs making me stronger than I‚Äôve ever been. I‚Äôm incredibly happy to be back running and lifting weights due to Caitlin and everyone at PT Solutions Smyrna! Thank you so much!"
"(This is Tim's wife, Andrea)  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Everyone there, from the friendly folks at the front desk, to the kind, knowledgeable and truly helpful therapists, is a pleasure to work with.  I was recovering from surgery and Caitlin, Todd, Erin and Shannon were each wonderful to work with, personalizing each session to my current needs, pain and abilities.  I am truly amazed at how much progress I've made, so quickly, under their care.  If you're considering physical therapy in or near Smyrna, this is your go to place for sure."
"The staff here is so warm and welcoming...Erin, my therapist, has such a sweet soul. She makes me feel so comfortable in an uncomfortable environment lol"
"I love everyone here!  They are all so supportive, interesting to learn from, and all give great care.  (This includes those that are not in the therapist role as well).  I have worked with every therapist here so I can say all of them are wonderful.   I came a few years ago for 2 issues, and now am back for post op for one of the earlier issues.  I will always choose to come here, and will recommend them to anyone who needs it!"
"When i first started at PT solutions smyrna, i didnt think i was going to get any better. But after the third or fourth visit, i started feeling better and stronger  I am so grateful for the confidence and strength they have given me. I am forever grateful. Please do not hesitate to give them a chance to make you feel better."
"Clean facility, friendly therapists. I hit very bad traffic on my first day and they did not turn me away when I was tardy, much appreciated!"
"Beyond Expectations. The Physical Therapists here are caring and knowledgeable. I'm sure I'll torture the names but Erin, Caitlyn, Todd, and Shannon are all true professionals. I went for shoulder problems and can attest to their dedication and commitment to their patients health. Look, no one want to have to go through therapy but if you must - go here. Oh, and the front staff and assistants were great as well. One last thing is during Covid-19 everyone wears their masks and you must do the same to protect them and us. Peace."
"I started at this location in mid-June after I pulled muscles in my trap and my GP referred me to physical therapy. I was initially on muscle relaxants to loosen the muscles but after a few sessions, I was able to go off relaxants completely. My primary therapist, Todd, has been amazing in not only massaging to loosen the muscles but also focusing on weight training to strengthen my back and avoid future injuries. I also have received dry needling from Erin and Shannon, who are both awesome, and this has helped tremendously. The staff, including Sarra, are extremely professional and courteous. I would highly recommend PT Solutions of Smyrna to anyone in need of a solid, comprehensive, and tailored physical therapy plan."
"All the staff have been excellent, from my first injury where Carson was my PT,  to Erin, to everyone who has subbed in. Jodi and I have always gotten superb treatment at PT Solutions of Smyrna."
"The team at Smyrna PT SOLUTIONS are very patient centered in delivering physical therapy to clients.
Their customer service culture is ""always"". Once you come in, they acknowledge you with a smile and begin working with you as quick as possible. The therapist evaluates you and tailors individual-based care while staying engaged with you during visits for the best outcomes of pain relief and regain of functionality.
I am happy with the physical therapy experiences I had at Smyrna PT SOLUTIONS."
"Highly recommend PT Solutions...Smyrna...professional staff...Todd is skilled, and has helped make my recovery easier. Patients deserve the kind of dedication offered there..."
Love them 3 times been there always  better at end there the greatest
"Todd and Sarra are the best, their professionalism is incredible and the care provided was exceptional. Come to PT solutions to get your physical therapy needs and your body back to normal in no time. Thanks guys you are amazing."
Excellent place! With excellent people!
The staff are friendly and very helpful in addressing my particular concern.  The therapies suggested targeted my issues and I started getting relief after the first session.
"Had the most wonderful experience there.  They were friendly, supportive and I had one on one care.  Place is always spotless and they understand if you have to reschedule.  Have been elsewhere and this is the best!"
"WARNING.  This location charged me over $800 for a visit that they said they had verified through my insurance as covered per my yearly PT allotment. Upon calling my insurance, to double-check (after I had already had my appointment), I discovered I did not, in fact, have any services left as insurance had been counting my chiropractic care as PT.  I was initially told due to the miscommunication that they would take care of it. 6 months later, out of the blue, I received a nasty call from their billing department demanding payment and when I tried to explain the situation they quipped that I was being sent to collections and hung up. If your going to use them, your going to need to verify your own visit allotment through your insurance vs letting them do it, otherwise you be swindled."
"I appreciate the convenient location but more importantly the cleanliness and on-time schedule. My therapist is Jenna, she's been wonderful and explains everything."
"I've received excellent post-surgery physical therapy treatment for several months, and am delighted by my progress.  The support staff is excellent as well, they treat me as family.  Overall it has been a great experience."
Very thorough and really personable!
I saw two different PT's at PT Solutions -- Erin and Todd. Both helped me with exercises for a contusion in my hip from a fall. Within a week I was better. They were great at explaining the exercises!
"After struggling with vertigo symptoms for a month, my doctor suggested I try vestibular therapy. I had tried medication, chiropractic, steam therapy, and anything else I could think of or was suggested to me. I ended up going out of the country before I could get into PT and that long episode went away on its own.

But when the vertigo came back about 3 months later, I immediately called PT Solutions to try vestibular therapy. I ended up working with Todd Scott. He did some preliminary tests to narrow down exactly what/where the crystals in my ear were misbehaving. He then did some PT moves and sent me on my way, after scheduling some follow up sessions. The next morning I woke up VERTIGO FREE! I was amazed! I almost didn‚Äôt believe it!!!

I will absolutely keep Todd on speed dial in the event my vertigo ever returns. My mother and my sister also suffer and if they ever have a flare up they will be in to see Todd as well! I really felt like Todd wanted to fix the problem and cared about me. Thank you so much PT Solutions!!!"
Staff is courteous and professional.  I am currently completing knee surgery rehab and have had 6 visits (2 per week) so far.  Each session was challenging but rewarding as I continue to make progress.  I would recommend this facility and staff to anyone that is in need to therapy in this part of the city.
Very friendly staff. My therapist is Shannon and she gives personal attention to therapy. Improvements every session. Front desk staff is very helpful too. Would def recommend.
I was diagnosed with an inflamed rotator cuff. At times the pain was excrutiating. I was assigned physical therapy twice a week at PT Solutions. The workout has made a significant difference. I can raise my arm a little higher now with no pain. I should be back to full motion once therapy is complete.
The therapists and staff are friendly and competent. They get to know you and remember details from prior appointments. Thankful to have found them in Smyrna!
"Great staff. They are professional, courteous and sympathize with your situation."
I'm truly amazed how well the staff treats me. They're so helpful and concerned. I will recommend everyone I know  to PT solutions.
Love the entire staff!! They go above and beyond and really feel like a community!
Best clinic ever   staff were incredible thanks...
"PT Solutions boasts great front desk staff, flexible scheduling, and knowledgeable therapists with lots of treatment options."
Very easy-going and friendly group. Extremely knowledgeable and respectful of your schedule. This location is new and clean.
Love Love Love them!  Always an appointment available and super friendly staff!  Physical Therapists really take their time with you.
The people working here are very good at what they do . They will get you back in great condition.     John C. Adams

Paul is incredible. Taught me a lot quickly. Thanks for your time and compassion.
"Excellent care by experienced clinicians.  Physical therapists, athletic trainers and Emory Sports Medicine physicians work together for the benefit of the patient and their well being."
"Excellent Care! Love this place.
Chris is awesome. Therapy includes Needling and Cupping."
"This is the place to go for physical therapy! Chris is an excellent physical therapist. He explains things and is very knowledgeable about his profession. I trust him and that means a lot. Kayla at the front desk is very nice and is always cheerful. Sometimes, when Chris is out,  I see Greg and he is great too. The level of confidence in what they do is superior. Chris has helped me so much getting me to where I need to be with walking normal again after breaking my foot and ankle twice within a year and a half and having CRPS in the same foot after injuries. I look forward to a full recovery! I cannot say enough great things about all of them!"
"When I wasn‚Äôt sure I would be able to get the physical therapy I needed, BenchMark Physical Therapy in Evans did not disappoint. Chris has the best care for my diagnosis which will help me reach my goal. It amazes me how I am capable to do the treatment and I am constantly reassured everything is to help build strength and I also know it doesn‚Äôt happen over night. So thank you Chris for working with me. You do make a difference in my life and I know others."
"Very pleased with the service given; Chris Goult, the knowledgeable therapist who helped me to complete wellness after my hip replacement was a pleasure to deal with and he is highly recommended. The whole team was friendly and engaging. The facility was clean and well organized. Very pleased with my experience there."
"I had a great experience there, and my injury is much, much better. Thanks to Greg & Chris, and the thoughtful receptionist.  All around a great visit!"
Great staff! I really appreciate them for caring for my needs and getting me back to my normal life activities! Thank you to everyone that helped me during my success to recovery especially Chris!!
BenchMark PT  is Awesome! Ive been to another PT place & it's not as good as this one! THANK YOU CHRIS!!! üòá
This is my second go around with benchmark Physical Therapy I fell Christmas day was operated on the next week and started physical therapy with Chris as my practitioner he did a great job then on my last session I left and fell again I was re-operated on I knew the only person I wanted to take care of me was Chris!
"I have been to a couple other physical therapists in the area since moving to GA (8) years ago. My therapist, Chris, was the most knowledgeable and attentive by far over my other experiences. I would highly recommend Benchmark, especially Chris."
"Very professional and always ready to help. Christoper, my therapist is very personable and
Competent . I would recommend Bench Mark therapy to my friend and family. I do feel difference in my pain after therapy. Office environment is also very friendly."
"The Physical Therapist at this location is amazing. He makes sure to spend time with our daughter when she comes in. He tailors her routine to her progress and although there are other patients in the office at the time, I never feel like she is neglected. By far the best PT place we have been to thus far."
"Great experience, professional & friendly staff, and Chris knows his STUFF!!!"
"I‚Äôve been seen at BenchMark for a while now and I must say, I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better clinic! Chris and Matt are both friendly, knowledgeable, and supportive of your journey to feeling better. Chris has been helping with my back issues and overall strength and I can already see vast changes not only in my back but my overall health and strength. They make you forget you‚Äôre even at therapy and I look forward to my appointments! ShirTina is always there to greet me with a warm smile and I am sure to laugh every time we chat."
"Outstanding Management and Staff ! I always enjoy my Therapy sessions with my Therapist. He's very knowledgeable
and caring of my needs and thrives to make sure that I am confident that he has my best interests at heart. I can't praise him and the entire staff enough ‚ÄºThanks Chris.."
The staff here are very patient and knowledgeable. Pleased with the progress I have made!! Thank you!
"Chris was a tremendous help, he worked with me to develop a PT regiment that was geared directly to my issues.  Very professional with a friendly atmosphere."
Brian is great PT good service v nice




BenchMark East Dahlonega is truly the best! They offer one-on-one patient care and make every patient feel special. Eric and Lindsey are incredibly knowledgeable and are always eager to help their patients! The whole staff is welcoming to every patient that walks in the door - check them out if you ever need any physical therapy!
"Eric Steed and his crew at the Longbranch location of Benchmark PT are wonderful.  They worked on my neck and shoulders following a car accident.  It is a pleasure to receive therapy from a group of professionals who really know what they are doing and care about your progress. Like the staff, the facility is top-notch and the methods are state of the art. I highly recommend this group."
"My mom needed PT after a bike incident. Eric Sneed was the most patient, caring, thoroughly competent therapist. Listened, answered thoughtfully, instructed and explained...what a very good man. The entire office is caring and so well run. Can‚Äôt recommend enough!"
"Was skeptical on if they would be able to help and glad I was wrong. Eric and his team were all great and very professional. When other doctors (orthopedic, thoracic, RA) said it was arthritis and nothing they could do. Eric came up with an therapy plan that I am now seeing early results. So I want to say thank you and I will continue all the exercises taught and give ya'll and update in a couple months on how things are progressing.

Highly recommend this location if anyone is in the need of physical therapy."
Benchmark Physical Therapy is awesome! Eric and Brooke are professional yet caring. They worked me hard but I recovered quickly and I'm still doing well.
"Absolutely incredible!! So kind and caring! Very personable and intentional! Shadowing here has been such a joy and a blessing. I get to watch them interact with their patients and see how they care for each of them. They don't just treat them for their pain, they invest in them and pour into their lives. I am always greeted with a smile when I come in and I always feel so welcomed. They also take time to teach me and show me different exercises to help me learn more about Physical Therapy. They keep it fun and lively, but also make sure it is a safe and comfortable environment for the patients. They are all such wonderful people and anyone who goes here is in GREAT hands!! They go the extra mile for everyone and make sure everyone is well cared for."
"Amazing staff. Each day I had physical therapy I was welcomed with a smile by Abby the wonderful receptionist. My main PT was Eric and he helped me out so much and whenever he wasn't there Josh was just as good. Lucy was always a great help as well. I loved going to PT even though it was hard. The whole staff encouraged me to keep growing and getting stronger. I was sad to ""graduate"" but the maintenance program is the next thing for me. Thank you BenchMark East. East is Beast."
"The staff here are truly special people, making this a perfect place to work towards recovery. Aside from providing excellent physical therapy service, they show genuine care about each of their clients, treating everyone like family. They catered to my needs and made me look forward to my appointments each week, and I have made so much progress during my time here. This facility is truly a special place!"
Came in for a one time visit with a small problem but was treated as if I had been a long term patient. Very attentive and personable staff who clearly care and genuinely want to help you find longstanding solutions to your problems. They were also very intentional in following up with me after my visit. Super clean and well kept. Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better experience!
My Physical Therapist is awesome. He listens and really cares about his patients.  They all work as a team and get along really well. Abbey at the front desk is s breath of fresh air.
I highly recommend this bench mark! Eric helped me deal with my lower back injury that I sustained months before. After about 3 months of seeing Eric I‚Äôm squatting again and back to training how I love to. Go check them out!
Great people AND service!!! Very knowledgeable in the practice and willing to accommodate to each individual. Great place to spend my recovery.
"Could not have made my journey back to running after meniscus surgery, without this great group. Thank you for all your professional guidance Eric, David, Lucy, and Abby. My Friday mornings won't be the same without you all."

"I have had a great experience with  PT solutions.  Krystal has been very supportive of my needs and helping me improve my knee's mobility,  I had never been to a physical therapy office and didn't know what to expect.  I am progressing along as I should and it isn't taking 6 months.  I am happy.  Thanks for much."
"I would give them 6 stars if I could. My first visit, I could not move my thumb and it hurt when Krystal barely touched it. After one short month of therapy I am as good as new and cannot be more thankful! I love this place!"
Excellent care.  Therapist is very knowledgeable and professional.  Well trained staff.  Highly recommended.
Awesome people.  We will be sad when over.  Feels like family.   üòÄ
"Marvelous place! Wonderful people! The exercises Kris had me do helped me very much. If I ever need PT again I will be definitely be back. I would rate them 6 stars out of 5, both therapists and Keri."
"Outstanding, Keri is very friendly and attentive. Kris the physical therapist is friendly and professional. They made me feel welcome. You can genuinely tell that they care and have compassion for there patients"
"My overall experience with PT Solutions has been satisfactorily satisfying.  The staff always asks, ‚Äú how has your day been?‚Äù There‚Äôs always engagements of quality conversations no matter the topics.  I highly recommend PT Solutions to start your bodies healing process."
"This team has gone above and beyond to help me get my body strength up. My injuries were long term damage and the difference in the before and after muscle strength is amazing. The at home exercises have helped me as well. They are always smiling and focused on each patient! I ALWAYS recommend Jess, Mea, Keri and Dylan! They have done amazing things with my care! Thank you so much to the team at Villa Rica!!!!! I will truly miss you all!"
The staff was very friendly and I am looking forward to working with the therapist they were eager to learn what brought me there and working with me in the future and getting me to where I need to be
Iv been going for 2 and a half weeks now and my arm has felt the best it has in over 4 months
"My son has been coming here to see Jessica since July of this year, and is making much improvement, the staff is so accommodating, having a 5 year old doing therapy twice a week can be a little time consuming, but they always make sure our time here is awesome. The front desk lady Keri, is the BOMB, she even gave Bryce a t-shirt, after he had a accident on his shirt so we didn't have to go home and miss his time here. They are more like friends! Way to go PT Solutions, you have a pretty awesome team here. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone!"
I refer any  & everybody to go to PT Solution‚Äôs they are amazing  and friendly they will have you feeling right  after you go for  the first session you want be disappointed with them!
"Ever since I first came here, Keri and Jessica have been very friendly and welcoming. I recently met Mia and she‚Äôs just as amazing. They all make me experience great and full of laughs."
Keri is always smiling and is always very welcoming as soon as we walk in the door. Jessica is very knowledgeable in her profession as a therapist. Jessica and Mea both make my son enjoy coming to therapy. He's been in PT a while but this is the first time he actually enjoys it. This team is highly recommended.
Hello I love this place PT SOLUTION I HAD SURGERY ON MY FOOT AND  I WAS IN PAIN BUT when I  started doing the therapy the pain keeps going away  chris know what he's doing  the customer service was very good  i would recommend PT SOLUTION TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS

"Awesome, friendly service, super professional and knowledgeable. Highly recommend!"
"PT Solutions in Villa Rica has been and continues to be a tremendous asset in my recovery. The staff is warm and friendly. Jessica is very attentive with her  patients and shows  a personal level of concern for my progress. I have been through several different stages of surgery and recovery during my time here. Keri is very personable and easy to work with for appts and insurance help. Mea lights up the room as the pt aIde. She truly gets to know the patients and spends time building that relationship and trust, as does Jessica and Keri. These ladies at PT Solutions Villa Rica are an important part of my continued perseverance and progress. I just love them and I know they truly  care about me and the patients here!"
Jessica (the therapist) is amazing!!!! She is INCREDIBLE with pediatrics (my daughter is 11) and adults! Jessica takes the time to get to know the  patient  and  is very specific to their needs. They always work around my crazy work schedule. I highly recommend this place.
Everyone is super nice and very accommodating for parents! I would recommend for any PT needs!!
This is an awesome place they have did so much for me the only improvement I have had in a year I got through them thank you Jessica and Kerry y'all are the best team around
"The staff at this facility is very supportive! Jessica‚Äôs expertise, patience, and encouragement is amazing!"
"Today my 71 year old  husband went for his six weeks recheck for a full knee replacement. The doctor said he was very excited about his progress!  Also said he was ahead of schedule on his recovery! Thanks to PT Solutions and our fantastic therapist, Jessica Bivins!  She pushed Jake beyond what he thought he could do. üòä And I would be totally remis if I did not mention the always smilling, Keri the receptionist and helper. Such a caring and professional office!!  Nothing but praises for this staff!!"
"Very friendly, knowledgeable, & helpful"
Wonderful staff. Extremely professional and helpful.
Staff is super friendly & professional.
Excellent














Appointments ran on time.  Therapist was attentive
The therapy I received was well planned and carried out each visit. I saw great improvement and will continue exercises at home.
"Indya Is Great, Professional, Patient And Understanding!..
Thank You, Indya..
Rhoda Timera"
"I had ACL reconstruction and Meniscus repair. I started physical therapy Dec 2018 through May 2019, for 6 months, even though it takes 9 months, my progress was good that my doctor released me from physical therapy.  The therapist were very knowledgeable and help me recover completely. My only complaint and the reason I gave 4 stars instead if five was that within those 6 months i had 4 different therapist, so just as I was getting use to one therapist and their treatments they would leave and I would start with another. All of their methods were good but you lose that personal connection with your therapist and they would have to get caught up on my progress notes"
Therapist are good but unprofessional atmosphere. The receptionist walked around the room with a plate of food eating the whole time I was there.


Chelsey is fabulous!  Love working with her as I work to get my shoulder back in working order!  Thx PT Solutions of Terrell Mill!
"If you want to heal faster PT Solutions of Terrell Mill is the place to go to. Dedicated staff at this location help's out in every step of the way and makes it a very pleasant experience. Special shout out to CHELSEY POWELL. She has been a great help in my healing journey. Her dedication, care and work ethics are exceptional. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone seeking help with their physical pain."
OMG I had a broken arm couldn‚Äôt move my arm at all! But pt solutions fixed me right up perfectly within two weeks ! these guys are amazing you got a try them out!
"This place is amazing! As a former athlete, dealing with injury I really needed some to help me get back to preforming at a top level and Chelsey got me here! Trust the process and it will work!"
"Amazing staff and facilities. Helped me recover from a very challenging, painful hand injury. Thank you, Chelsea!!"
"Incredibly friendly and knowledgeable staff! I only came for two appointments and in one week, my hamstring was fixed! Hopefully I won't have another injury, but if something happens, this will be my very first call! Great experience!"
"One word says it all. AWESOME!  It starts with coming in for your appointment. Jasmine greets you with a smile, we can‚Äôt see smiles with masks on, but you see it in her eyes and hear it in her voice. Chelsey also does the same seeing you as you come in. She is very knowledgeable and has helped me so much. I‚Äôm a difficult patient with my always changing symptoms but I always leave feeling better. I know Chelsey will get me back to 100%, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt keep coming back. Thank you so much for helping me get to where I want to be, pain free."
Chelsea is a consummate professional and truly cares about your well-being.
"Listen, nobody wants to have to go to physical therapy. It usually means you're hurt somehow. But if you do have to go, PT Solutions is terrific. I have some experience with physical therapy and I can say the clinicians and support staff provide top level care. I've heard a few stories of how other physical therapy clinics either wrote a patient off, didn't provide appropriate treatment, or just didn't have good customer service. I've literally never heard any of those things about PT Solutions and that certainly hasn't been my experience. Plenty of space in the Terrell Mill clinic so you don't feel on top of other people. Chelsey and other PT's/PTA's were able to balance seeing multiple patients while not making me or others feel ignored. If I had any questions they were able to address them immediately or within a reasonable time. I never felt like I couldn't reach out with an email or call to the clinic with questions (unlike the doc). I went from not really being sure I'd be able to walk again without pain to doing everything I was doing before my injury with essentially no pain at all. That is in large part due to the work they put in for me. They really helped me get my confidence back. Do yourself a favor and get PT here. It will be 100% worth it."
Chelsey was a life saver when I broke my ankle in February. She was patient yet challenged me appropriately. My recovery experience here was super pleasant I could not have asked for more.
I loved my experience here. The entire staff was great and I especially enjoyed working with Chelsea and Amy. They were always professional and catered to my needs. I made a complete recovery from my injury and highly recommend PT Solutions. This location is very convenient and everyone is COVID aware and safe. I saw staff wipe down items and equipment regularly. While they may work you hard it is well worth it to be able to get back to normal. Thank you all!
"Great place for therapy. Chelsea is very knowledgeable and always encouraging, though she does challenge you to push forward. Jazymne was very helpful in getting my billing and insurance information straight. Overall, everyone at this facility is polite, professional and gets the job done. PT Solutions gets high marks from me and I have had therapy at several different locations. Thank you PT!"
The staff here is so sweet and I highly recommend coming!!
Had a great experience at PT Solutions of Terrell Mill.  I came in not being able to walk normally.  Chelsey was able to work with me and I was back to normal in 4 shorts week!  She was very accommodating and adjusted our in-person sessions and in-home exercises as needed.  I highly recommend PT Solutions of Terrell Mill to anyone needing physical therapy.
"Dr. Powell and her staff are cordial and willing to listen, customize and adjust to make the PT experience just what you need it to be. The facility is clean and doesn't feel like a gym, but a place to recover and rejuvinate."
"I've cycled through issues with both knees, a hip, my lower back, and follow up after two surgeries with Chelsey and team. Each time, they've gotten me fixed up with great care and a fun atmosphere. They make sure my therapy goals are met and that I've learned what I can do at home to maintain my progress. I'm glad PT|Solutions opened this location with this team. They're everything I need when I've got an issue."
This is a great location. Jazmyne is very friendly and keeps me up to date on my insurance information. Chelsey is very attentive and knowledgeable. I have seen a tremendous improvement in my injury recovery since starting my therapy process here and would definitely recommend choosing this place.
"I recently completed my treatment for plantar fasciitis that I had been suffering from for months. Dr Chelsey Powell began a treatment plan and I now have experienced full recovery.  I wish I had gone sooner instead of thinking the problem would fix itself. I have a home plan to work on to keep me in top shape. Jasmin, also,  was always smiling and happy to greet me and set up return appointments. I recommend this group and this location. They are excellent."
"Chelsey's done a great job at helping me w/lower back pain due to a herniated disc. She's a great listener, very flexible, and very positive! Before I had back pain just standing up straight, and now I'm able to work out again. At the front desk, Jazmyne's also really kind and is a delight to work with. Highly recommend."
I highly recommend this place for physical therapy! Chelsey and her staff all did a great job at creating a personalized plan to accommodate my rehabilitation.
PT Solutions of Terrell Mill is a FABULOUS location for any physical therapy needs you may have. I was having some trouble with my feet/ankles and Chelsey was AMAZING! She challenges you in a caring manner! She got me to push myself further than what I would have done alone. She‚Äôs friendly and personable! Jazmyne (front office) is also very welcoming and patient. They work very well together and accommodate their patient‚Äôs crazy schedules. I truly have had a great PT experience at this location. Great job ladies!!!
"Kind, helpful, efficient and just the right combination of what you need to recover. Very knowledgeable staff and close to our neighborhood!"
"PT Solutions is an excellent experience for Physical Therapy. Chelsey and staff are friendly and care about their clients. I will most certainly refer them to all those that need PT services.

Thank you PT Solutions!"
I have been blown away by the degree of professionalism and attention to detail I have experienced at PT Solutions.  Chelsey runs a spotlessly clean well oiled machine and really knows her business.  I felt a marked improvement in my back after the first visit and continue to improve each week.  I feel very comfortable in giving this fine business FIVE STARS.
Two years ago I had a total knee replacement and was introduced to Chelsey Powell. She saved me.  No really.  I could not have survived with out her treatment and knowledge of the situation.  So now two years later I am back with the other knee replacement.  But this time from day two.  The facility is super safe and they are taking every precaution for the safety of everyone entering the building.   We have followed Chelsey to two locations and will continue to stay with her for any future pains.
"I‚Äôve spent two years dealing with some severe neck and jaw pain. I‚Äôve seen several doctors, spent thousands of dollars on treatments/procedures, and went to 40 sessions of PT at a different company, but I‚Äôve seen more progress in a couple sessions of PT Solutions than all of those combined.

The staff is friendly and empathetic. I was nervous about going with the pandemic happening, but they keep the location extremely clean, everyone is wearing a mask, and they limit how many people can be inside at one time.

For the first time in two years, I feel hopeful that I might get my life back on track."
"Excellent service from the therapist.
Very caring and understanding with the issues and working out a detailed therapy program.
They are very patient friendly and accommodating to working within your schedule .
Highly recommend using PT Solutions of Terrell Mill."
"PT Solutions is my go to for healing. Pain in hips, legs, back, feet, anything really can be healed through their expert training and treatment. Thank you PT Solutions for guiding me on this journey of wellness!"
"Chelsey Powell at PT Solutions of Terrell Mill is as good as they come. She has helped my wife rehab from a knee replacement and has helped me with back, hip, and shoulder issues. She really knows her stuff and will go the distance to find therapies that improve your pain and range of motion. Outstanding."
"Chelsey and her team are the utmost professionals.  After months of treatment, I am ‚Äúgraduating‚Äù from therapy today.  I am so thankful for them and would recommend them to anyone!"
They are wonderful with my daughter and very patient! Chelsey is very good and has educated a lot  as to what we can do to help. Thx pt solutions!
"I love to come to physical therapy, and I‚Äôm really enjoying my progress. On top of that, it is always clean and people always wear masks."
I have been a client at PT Solutions of Terrell Mill for approximately 5 weeks and have noticed a significant improvement in my ability to perform certain tasks.  My association at this facility has been very positive.  The staff is professional in their treatments and very attentive to my needs and progress. They are friendly and make my visits there enjoyable.
"The therapist at PT solutions are great!! The are helping my granddaughter regain her mobility. She says her pain has decreased alot! If you need PT, check them out!!"
"Chelsey is great! I highly recommend getting dry needled, it makes all the difference in my neck and shoulder pain."
Chelsey is the best!!! Very professional and courteous! She makes you feel very personable.
"Wonderful dedicated therapists who work well together strive to improve whatever therapy need that you have
.  They are knowledgeable,  listen , and explain or answer any questions that you may have.  Always feel good that I have improved when I leave."
"Really wonderful group of folks. Professional, knowledgeable, and caring!

* March 2021 I am updating from a couple of years ago. I came back for a different type of PT. I knew that I would get the help that I needed; with empathy, kindness and thorough indepth medical knowledge.

Thank you to Chelsey and her team. Chelsey runs the Delk road location with the utmost of professionalism and business acumen. I feel completely safe, even during this crazy pandemic in their care. THANK YOU!!"
You enjoy your time with the staff at PT Solutions. They make the time there productive and enjoyable.  Truly a professional atmosphere. One of the best in Atlanta.
"The sweet ladies listen to me talk.  In this pandemic time, listeners are welcomed & appreciated."
"Professional, caring, encouraging.  This PT center is crisp and new with a great staff.  Your outlook gets therapy right along with your body.  Get well and stay well with this team. üëå"
Pt solutions were great
"Ashley is a gifted therapist.  The staff is warm, friendly and professional.  They are attentive to our needs.  The clinic is clean and well maintained.  And for me, the location is perfect!  Right around the corner from my house."
"Very polite, concerned, and educating!"
I love the staff at this clinic!!!!!!
"Ashley, Megan and Candace have helped me tremendously during my neck and leg recovery.  I hope i never need them again but if I do, this is the place to go."
I believe that they deliberately inflict pain.  Sadistic.
Great service





"Best place, therapy workouts are a challenge however they continue to help with physical improvements that can be incorperated into daily lives. Awesome physical therapist!!"
"I could not have asked for a better experience. The staff, especially Kaitlin and Nicki, are so helpful and kind. They push you to do your best, while maintaining a sense of humor and encouragement. They truly listen and work to fix what the issue is. I started physical therapy here with terrible pain every day, and now at the end of my treatment plan I hardly ever have issues. They have been such a blessing and I highly recommend them."
Very helpful and friendly people
Fantastic staff. They genuinely care about you and want to help you as much as possible. I was very impressed with Kaitlin. She is extremely nice and incredibly knowledgeable.
Kaitlin is wonderful! She is very patient and knowledgeable! While maintaining a professional role she connects with her patients and makes them feel appreciated! She has made my healing process one that I can enjoy and I see positive results everytime I go! I always look forward to my PT visits! Would highly recommend!
The staff here are amazing. Very friendly and smiling. They offered so much help to me and helped some issues I was having at the time. I highly recommend!
Kaitlyn and Kara are the bomb!  I couldn't ask for a more positive experience than what I'm currently receiving in treatment there.  Both are friendly and positive.  I am gaining motion weekly and loving it!
"A few weeks ago I developed a problem with my left foot, suffering much pain in my heel. Thinking the problem was a bone spur, the orthopedic dr, after xrays, diagnosed plantar fasciitis and referred me to Benchmark Therapy in Toccoa Ga.  I didn't know what to expect but  Kaitlin, the therapist, was excellent in getting me started with the therapy and making me feel comfortable.  The Benchmark Therapists are very knowledgeable in all types of injuries,  joint, back & neck  problems .. . . . ."
This place has the friendliest staff and are well trained. They really push you in order to make your recovery complete . I have recommended them to lots of others including family members. Thanks for what you did for me.   BILL Goodwin
"Such a wonderful place to recover from aches and muscle tightness.  The members of the staff are very professional and care so much about your recovery.  They make you feel at easy,  are so cordial and helpful in achieving your goals.  I recommend BenchMark Physical Therapy to all my friends and family.  I'm very much grateful for their help in making me feel better."
"The STAFF here is amazing!! They're all very professional, and compassionate. Although you're working hard to get stronger, the staff makes it a fun and safe environment. I'd give them 10 stars if I could! Thanks to you all for helping me keep my spirits up!"
"I highly recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy in Hinesville, Georgia.  My treatment experience while a patient there was mostly with Yiselle, but my interaction with everyone, from the other therapists to the sweet ladies who greet everyone at the front desk always made me feel so welcomed and truly cared for.   It felt as if I was saying goodbye to family members when I completed my last visit.  I highly recommend them all for professional care, compassion and attentiveness.  Thank you,Yiselle, and everyone at Benchmark Hinesville!  Keep up the awesome job!  You are so appreciated! .... y‚Äôall should create t-shirts with your logo...lol!  I‚Äôd love to spread the word!!"
"The therapists are amazing and even though you are there because you need to be there, I always liked going because we had great fun while still becoming better. Tan Van is an amazing therapist and so is Jazelle.  I walked out today knowing how to continue progressing at home and knowing if I ever needed anything I can count on them to help"
Definitely the best staff ever! Tan was the man! He helped me surpass my pain and feel better than the first day I started with Benchmark. Would give 10 stars if I could!
"The team at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Hinesville are the best of the best. From Nicole, Jezelle, Tan to the ladies at the front desk. I've used this facility several time due to shoulder issues to both surgeries. I would highly recommend Benchmark to my friends and family."
"Another fantastic and successful section at the best Physical therapy in Hinesville! Thank you YISELLE and TAN, Dawn, Daphne and all the staff for helping me getting back to almost full range of motion with my neck and shoulder injury! Love you guys!! Love this place! Recommend it to everyone who needs to get back on track with physical therapy!"
"It was an amazing experience, I made a lot of progress within a short while and am well and fit again. Shout out to all the staffs and thank you Ms Rachel for all your efforts.  I highly recommend this place."
"I can't speak highly enough of the care and treatment I received during my sessions at Benchmark. Yvette is an amazing physical therapist. I could go on and on about how wonderful she is.
She is very knowledgeable about her profession. She takes the time to communicate with you so that you can understand your condition, therefore this will help you execute the treatment plan.
I only had a couple of sessions with Rachel but I was  very pleased with her also during those sessions.
Jasmine, the administrative assistant, was friendly and polite.
I highly recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy."
"The therapists there are very attentive, mission focused, relatable and they make rehabilitation fun!!! Great staff and experience all around!"
"I love Benchmark therapy. The therapist (Mrs Yvette and Mrs Rachel are very nice and they make sure that you have the best workout possible to improve your injury. Even when you can't go no longer, they encourage you to push harder and strive for the best results. They are like your family away from home. Thank you for the encouragement and generosity. Also thank you to Mrs Jasmine for her hospitality. She is very nice and greets you. They all are wonderful. Thanks ladies."
I highly recommend Benchmark Therapy.   They are very attentive to the needs of each of their patients!  Very much a family feel to this organization!
Rachel was amazing! I‚Äôm so pleased with the progress I made in such a short among of time.
I have nothing but great things to say about Benchmark.  Hannah and Rachel are absolutely great and understanding.  I always feel like they are truly happy with what they do and make me feel important.  They know how to motivate me every time I go in.
"From day one I was fully satisfied with every part of my therapy. Every therapist is knowledgeable and very capable of handling all types of therapy. The plus is, they make you feel like family."
"The Employees include family in program
Talk to family like we are important"
Rachel and her team are awesome. Very polite & professional.
Great facility with great customer service.
"BenchMark is my place of choice for therapy. The clinic staff has become like family to me. Hannah, Rachel, Yvette and Nicole are totally awesome and personal with each patient. I enjoy coming to therapy"
The staff and environment is great! They have helped me out a lot.
The Staff here is awesome!!!!! They are very professional and Yvette Ewens is the best!!!!! I highly recommend this facility and Yvette Ewens as your therapist.
Absolutely love the staff here. They treat you like family and genuinely care about their patients. I've seen Yvette for a number of issues and she always goes above and beyond with her care. Marilyn and Josh are friendly and professional. Highly recommend if you're needing physical therapy in Hinesville.
"The sessions were complete and thorough, the staff very professional and caring about your pain levels and progress"
"Friendly staff, friendly environment."
"I enjoy the staff, they are very friendly and very concern about getting you feeling better.
I go in in pain and come out feeling much better. Even though its a good workout I enjoy because it has helped me and others I work with see the difference.
Thank you,
C. McKenzie"
"They put in üíØ percent to getting back on your feet ,everyone is very friendly they are like a family ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
I‚Äôve gone to several different physical therapy offices over the past 10 years. BenchMark in Hinesville is by far the best I have attended. Every employee genuinely cares about the patients. The staff at Benchmark actually make going to physical therapy enjoyable.
Highly recommend Nicole if you are looking for a PT in Hinesville or Richmond Hill! She is very approachable and personable and  works with you to get to get you where you want to be. I also recommend the dry needling!
Nicole is a God!! The Hinesville office always has a positive stress-free vibe. I dont dread going to this location. I actually look forward to getting to our next step in treatment because I know I'll feel relief soon after. ‚úåü§ô
"Great, friendly atmosphere,  knowledgable therapists. Laid back therapy that stays on task. Highly recommend."
"Absolutely love the staff, very friendly and helpful! They make an effort to help you feel better!"
"So far this is the best physical therapy I have ever been too.  I was a little nervous as I have never been to one not connected to a hospital.  However the therapist I am seeing is so knowledgeable that she has connected several areas of pain to one thing, and we are working on addressing all the parts."





Compassionate and very capable staff who speak multiple languages. Great therapists!
"The staff at this location provided a very effective plan for dealing with my balance issues and hip/leg pain. After suffering for years I can only say I wish I had not waited so long to go here.  Friendly, caring and knowledge health professionals."
Excellent  attention and a very good human quality in all its Staff
I love ‚ù§Ô∏è this facility they are always nice and on time the place is clean and my physical therapist is very knowledgeable of my injuries
"WARNING, Keep your copay receipt for years. I just got billed for a visit that was over one year old. The bill was for the copay they claimed I didn't pay. The first thing this place does when you sign in is collect your copay. There is no way I didn't pay this. I always pay cash and didn't keep the receipt, I will from now on. Looks like I'll have to keep these copay receipts for years.

James Montoya"
Marissa is the BEST appointment scheduler in the Western Hemisphere.


She‚Äôs very patient and knows her job very well I‚Äôll recommend her services to anyone that‚Äôs in need of PT. Thanks ramy
Amazing people. They are very welcoming and have great energy and they know what they are doing
Ramyadevi Ramamoorthi is an excellent and exemplary person! She is very courteous and caring with my wife! She knows her profession very well and it shows how she conduct herself during the treatment! We are very happy with her!
I recommend  this place staff is friendly and do right-treatment according you need
"After having surgery on a torn meniscus in my knee, I had physical therapy at this facility. They all were very knowledgeable, professional and kind group of people. They knew their stuff and treated me like family. When I stepped in the building they recognized me by name. If anyone needs a therapist after surgery I would greatly recommend them."
"I called from 3 weeks ago to get an appointment and they asked me for my insurance and they said they accepts it. They sent me paperwork to my email including my insurance information again. Today which is before my appointment tomorrow, they called to check on my insurance again and said they do not accept my insurance !!! after waiting for 3 weeks for the appointment and sending all the paperwork and now they do not accept it. very unprofessional and disappointed. That shows a very poor management !"
"Raghavender Nelakosigi, PT at Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center is extremely professional and cuorteous. My recovery is very swift and even though I am still under treatment I am convinced that I will recover fully."
"Nice, Friendly, very gentle and efficient."
I went to Emory @ Sugarloaf for a PFD therapy and was very impressed with the knowledge and care of the specialized therapist that treats PFD. The therapist is well versed on Pelvic Floor Dysfunction and allowed me to feel very comfortable when I was there for treatment. She also held me accountable to treatment and therapy practices at home and was always available if I had questions. Thank you Emory @ Sugarloaf for having this much needed resource available to women in the Atlanta area.
Staff is incredibly helpful and knowledgeable
"I love the staff at Emory. I‚Äôve been under the care of Ragu, the manager and lead therapist, since April 2020.  He is definitely a miracle worker. I walked in with serious pain in my left shoulder of which I am today pain free.  I was told by my surgeon that I needed shoulder replacement and by my Nurologist that I had carpal tunnel.  Both of these diagnoses were proven wrong and I am so grateful to Emory Rehabilitatiion Center for their expertise, candidness,  and professionalism.  Kudos also go to the staff: Lisa, the receptionist, and Pushpa, and Brook, the PT‚Äôs.  Without fail, they consistently  treated me with the utmost respect and demonstrated excellent knowledge and skill in their profession."
I‚Äôm currently going to Emory Rehab. It‚Äôs such a pleasant environment. I‚Äôm always greeted by the friendly staff! Ms.Retha and Ms.Carmen are so kind and caring. They take the time to make sure I‚Äôm receiving the proper care for my injury. They are qualified specialists and I hope my recovery will be speedy! ABSOLUTELY THE BEST PLACE FOR REHAB!!!!
"Therapists go out of their way to try to make you feel better. The two therapists I have worked with are both much smaller than me, yet they somehow figure out how to leverage my bones and joints back into their proper alignment. The Staff is friendly and arranging appointments has been easy for me. I also appreciate their respect for my time. I have never had to wait around past my appointment time to begin my session. The facility itself is clean, well equipped and maintained. You can't go wrong selecting the Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center as both my wife and I have."
"My PT Pushpa Dureddy is wonderful. She is caring, takes time with me and so encouraging. I am so glad I found her and confident the exercises she has given me will help me for a lifetime."
"Everyone here is friendly, warm and caring. The therapists are genuinely concerned with the health and well-being of everyone that they work with. Other people receiving treatment appear to be having a similar positive experience. They may be in pain and having physical difficulties, but they know that they are in good hands. I am very pleased with my treatment here and recommend it to anyone needing physical therapy."
"Clinton is a very knowledge in physical therapy.  He has been very patient with me during and after my spinal surgery
recovery.  He knows when to push me a
little and when to back off.
I would not hesitate at all in recommending Chin as a referral!"
"If you are in need of Physical or Occupational therapy, this is the place. I have used 4 or 5 different places over the years, and this is by far the best I have ever seen. Everyone from the front desk to the PT/OT staff are welcoming, professional and they treat you with thoughtful care."
"I found the calm, peaceful environment to be a great setting in which my  physical therapist asked questions about my issues, how they impacted my life, and then together worked with me on activities and exercises that focused on my pain and mobility issues.  The PT taught me an exercise at a time, watched me perform it on my own, and kindly offered suggestions to enhance my performance of the exercise.  I was given printouts to use as reference as I carried out these exercises at home and in-between PT appointments .  At the beginning of each appointment, I was asked about any new or ongoing issues & these issues were then incorporated into the day's appointment.  I could usually get the appointment times/days that best fit into my schedule.  We discussed what my goals were and how we could best achieve them.  It seems like every individual needs to have a physical therapist they can turn to as certain health problems pop up."
The staff is very knowledgeable about their craft. They explain things to you  in a way you can understand. They are pleasant and courteous. I would recommend them to people I know.
"I've had PT on and off, on almost every joint in my body, my entire adult life.  Ragu is the BEST I have ever known.  I had sacral joint pain for over 10 years.  After 4 months with him with massage, manipulation and simple exercises I was pain free.  If any pain comes back, I just do the exercises wherever I am (that simple) the pain goes away.  Shoulder injury 25 years ago is finally healing under his care.  He is kind, knowledgeable, and thorough."
All the therapists are amazing. They are kind and encouraging but they push you. The ladies up-front are also great. Everyone here makes a full recovery possible.

I am very happy to see everyone there and I feel good when they are done with me.

"Clean, bright, happy, friendly, professionals working towards the best possible outcome for their client's.  Adairsville now has a physical therapy solution that are trail blazers in the profession. The most dynamic,  innovative therapy and support one could ask for.
I highly recommend PT Soultions  Adairsville to bring peace, happiness, comfort and wellness in your life üíö"
"Everyone is absolutely amazing! I couldn't
ask for a friendlier environment.üòÅüòÅüòÅ"
Kyle and Christina are awesome!!! Kyle makes PT interesting and fun! Love the atmosphere with these two!
"Nice people. PT, Kyle, takes time to explain what he's doing and why. Professional, clean atmosphere."
"Very nice people, I like here so far."
They were very rude and uncaring.  They also talk about you behind your back.


"I scheduled an appointment a month ago. Lost the slip to the time. Started calling this morning at 8:00am along with the Emory scheduler trying to get someone at the Physical Therapy desk to answer. Sent several emails to the contacts I have available. The lady there just doesn‚Äôt want to answer the phone. Finally I leave a voicemail after attempting 12 times only for her to call back 14 minutes after my appointment time saying she‚Äôs been on the phone with insurance companies all morning. I was so used to the great treatment of Emory and assumed that since it carries Emory‚Äôs namesake, I would still get the same great customer service. WRONG!! No appointment reminders or anything. Emory do better!"
"The actual physical therapy was great. I loved it.

Why the one star. 100% the billing.

They admitted to making a mistake. Quoting me $20 per visit with my insurance and for months that is what I paid. After almost 2 months of visits twice a week I get a bill for 10x the amount I was quoted. I call the billing only to get a Karen who admitted she and Emory made a mistake yet I'm still expected to pay 10x the amount I agreed to. An amount I would have never gone twice a week or even picked that location. My ONLY reason to choose Emory was the cost and now after they lied about the cost for months they expect to get 10x the amount we agreed on.

They don't even have their payment processes correct. They write in a paper ledger and give paper receipts. This mistake should have been figured out MUCH MUCH sooner yet I'm stuck with an outrageous bill and when I said TWICE I wanted to escalate it I got no response. I'm absolutely disgusted that a company like Emory is even ALLOWED to do this. Be 100% careful because you will ask ALL the correct questions up front, do all the research and still get screwed over by their incompetent billing department which isn't even IN Georgia."
"Eric Nichols is my physical therapist at this Emory Smyrna location. I recommend Eric for all physical therapy needs. He has the knowledge and the expertise to help you with all your physical therapy needs. His demeanor is always in the mode of making sure that the patient receive the exact and precise therapy that‚Äôs needed for repair. He seems to enjoy working with all people, personalizing each session. Watching him work with some of his other clients, he certainly projects the skills, empathy, and works with the patient to gain the confidence to work through the painful process of therapyüíØ MOST OF THE REVIEWS ABOUT THE THERAPIST ARE POSTED BUT WE FORGET ABPUT THOSE WORKER BEES THAT COORDINATE THE PATIENT APPOINTMENTS..
‚ÄúBRIA  GREGORY‚Äù ON THE FRONT DESK SEEMS TO HAVE NO BAD DAYS, SHE‚ÄôS A JEWEL! ALWAYS A REFRESHING SMILE AND WILLINGLY HELPFUL  WHEN YOUR IN PAIN COMING OR GOING FROM THERAPY, BRIA‚ÄôS SMILE AND SWEET DEMEANOR IS CONTAGIOUS!!!!üíØ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

One is more than they deserve. They don‚Äôt throughly evaluate patients and randomly give exercises. The. Don‚Äôt pay attention to see if it a good fit for clients.



"Dr. Scott Lowe and his team have the best PT Office in Georgia!  They exhibited outstanding knowledge, expertise and follow up.  It doesn't get better than this for rehabilitation and I highly recommend them."
"I have just finished my therapy with Scott Lowe, and I was sad to have it come to an end.  That's because Scott is a wonderful person, whom I will miss seeing.  He's compassionate and kind, and his knowledge is extensive.  Additionally, he explains his treatment in easy to understand terms, and he answers all questions with patience and in easy to understand language.

The Benchmark clinic seems to run flawlessly.  The staff are all very friendly and welcoming.  The assistants are always ready to help with your program, ensuring that you are never left waiting for your next exercise.  The schedulers are really on top of things, offering reminders of appointments and working with you to find workable ways times for your scheduling.

You will be happy that you chose Benchmark!!"
I am so pleased with the care I am receiving at this BenchMark location. The staff is very professional and fun at the same time. All COVID precautions are in place. Scott and his staff are top notch!!
"BenchMark Physical Therapy in Woodstock in the Kroger Shopping Center at 92 and Trickum was awesome.  Scott Lowe and staff were attentive and delivered on what my needs were, not cookie cutter by any means.  Not only did they get my left knee (total replacement) in great shape, they guided me to get my right knee prepped for the same in February.  Scott helped get me ahead of schedule for both knees."
"was a fantastic experience, great PEOPLE, and loved working with JENNA, AND EVERYONE AT FACILITY, GOT ME WHERE i needed to be to recover from a stroke, Jenna was very kind, and was very caring about getting me better, I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS FACILITY, AN WILL DEFINETLY RETURN IF I NEED MORE WORK."
I had knee replacement surgery 4 weeks ago and Emily has been the best at helping me get my groove back! What I like most is that they work as a team..its a team environment and they all care about your rehab. I highly recommend them you will see results.
"This was my second time going to  Benchmark East Woodstock. They were great, again. All my goal were met or surpassed. I worked with Chris Ross, who was excellent, as were all the other employees I came into contact with. I highly recommend them."
"I have been going here for three weeks now, and I have to say that it has been a very positive experience. Everyone here is absolutely amazing, kind, and very engaging. Even though we are there for recovery of some kind, the energy of the therapists makes it an absolute pleasure for us all."
"I am very happy with the results of my therapy with Dr. Christopher Roth.
He was very attentive to my needs and his instructions were easy to follow.
I feel a lot better with the information he gave me during each exercise and what each exercise was for and how it will improve my back issues. He gave me exercises to do at home. I would definitely recommend Dr. Roth at Benchmark  to my friends and family."
"This location is one of the best, the staff go above and beyond what I have seen any other PT Office do.
Dr. Scott, Abby, Nancy, Emily, Madison are some of the most wonderful and pleasant people. They are always warm & welcoming and they do a 200% job + at making sure you have a positive, speedy recovery.
In my entire life I have never come across a more dedicated team devoted to their craft. The tender care they use and pride they take to help others.
The facility is always clean and the restroom is spotless, and the riddle of the week helps keep my mind active. I'm so grateful with everything this office has help in piecing my daily life back together. They are the best and have taken a long painful experience and changed it into a wonderful and pleasant journey."
I was very please with the attention I got. I would recommend it. Thanks
"Dr. Christopher is my favorite!  He was so patient with me, my mother and my brother though our recovery process from an accident. He would go at our speed and push us just enough to where it wouldn't cause more pain. He's also pretty good with his spanish. Thank you so much chris! your awesome!"
This place is the BEST! They will work you into their schedule to get the therapy you need. They are extremely friendly and really listen to your concerns and comments. The therapy on me is very effective. My knee is so much better and they have done this with almost no discomfort to me. I really look forward to my appointments.
"Great staff, happily rehabilitated from lateral meniscus tear. Highly recommended!"
"Great team work between therapists and assistant pT‚Äôers, runs on time, spotless environment and cleaned consistently. Everyone is upbeat, positive and super adaptable to ones situation. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre ailin‚Äô. üëç"
"If you are requiring physical therapy‚Ä¶..no need to look any further!!  I can not say enough great things about Scott Lowe of Benchmark Physical Therapy who is the BEST in his field!  Scott is so knowledgeable, so highly skilled, and takes the time to teach and explain the reasons for his treatment.
I am also truly impressed with the courtesy, attentiveness, and knowledge of the staff, as well.

I am actually sad that I am coming to the end of my treatment after a full knee replacement because Scott and his staff have not only taught me so much, but are folks whom I will really miss seeing on a regular basis.

Thank you, Scott and the Benchmark Physical Therapy staff, I have been very fortunate to have been treated by you!"
"I have been attending to this location after my accident. They are very professional. From the office managers, the Physical therapists, the techs or assistance. Attending to the Physical needs, as well as the scheduling always trying to accommodate appointments according to my schedule.
Thanks for your continuous service even during this hard times.   God bless y‚Äôall."
"Super great staff and always friendly.  Their goal is to help you recover and or improve your condition, whatever that may be.  Louisa is wonderful and very knowledgeable.  She is always concerned about your condition and works very hard in helping to correct your problem."
"So after 7 months I am in great shape.   I went in for treatment to rehab a fractured hip and shoulder.
The hip went rather quickly, but the shoulder is a whole other story.
Ups and downs frustrated both Scott and I.  Though still stiff, and considering where I started, I am in great shape.
Scott and crew are fantastic and great to work with.  From day one I had full confidence in the entire team.

GREAT JOB GUYS !!!"
Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Really feel like they care! look forward to working with them over the next few months! Definitely recommend serious
"I have been very happy with my treatment at BenchMark- from my initial evaluation to the care and treatment each and every time I've gone there. Scott is attentive and knowledgeable as a PT. Abby, Noelia and Nancy have been my PT assistants(techs). They listen to me and adjust each exercise to fit how I'm feeling that day. I have had my pain problem for many months and after a few weeks of therapy, I am feeling better and seeing results."
"I can't say enough about the excellent help I have received at Benchmark   East Woodstock.  When I started my journey with Dr. Scott and his amazing associates, I thought I might have to give up walking or at least use a cane or walker.  In no time at all with their gentle care and guidance I began to pull out of my downward spiral.  Thank you seems so little to say for such a splendid gift as my restored mobility.  If you are looking for excellent care and friendly people, this little place is where you need to be!"
"Dr Scott Lowe and his team are great.  Very friendly and knowledgeable, I look forward to seeing them to receive my care.  I highly recommend them!"
The staff at benchmark east Woodstock are the best people I have ever had contact with pretaining to my health in years they are all very concerned to make sure you get the best care for your condition. Scott is always making sure you are comfortable regardless of the pain you are experiencing while he is performing what is necessary to get you in good health as soon as possible. Abby Noelia Nancy and Emily are the greatest. Have recommended several of my friends to this establishment and will continue to do so if I happen to meet up with anyone who needs physical therapy
Great and amazing team of people to work with. They explain everything they want you to do and why you are doing it!! Emily is awesome!!
Been 2 months now and I am thrilled with my improvement. Mine is a tough one but this team has me hitting good strides with my marathon recovery !!!
"Therapist,  Scott,  is thorough with questions and listens to the patient.  Then, creates  custom therapy exercises for the patient, ensuring patient understand what to do.   Equipment and office is clean. Staff is friendly and professional.  I never feel rushed going through PT exercises."
Very professional team.  Everyone is attentive to each individual.  They help me stay focused and get the most out of my time there and my exercises.  The location is great and convenient.
Great experience working with Dr. Kris Ross and the staff.
"Geena , Scott and the hole crew are wonderful. They also make you feel like family and show you all the attention you need. I am starting to feel better every time I go there. Geenas cold hands are great, look forward to going to therapy. They are the BEST....Thanks Frank"
"Post rotator cuff surgery,  Scott Lowe was highly recommended by my surgeon as the PT  to lead me through my recovery.  One week left to go on my PT. Compared to others I've consulted who have been through this surgery,  I am delighted with my progress. I drive by many other PT locations to get here. Well worth it.  Get a PT and surgeon who communicate with one another. And as noted by others,  his assistants Abby,  Noelia,  and Nancy are first rate."
"Scott, Noelia Abby, Nancy and Luisa are extremely proficient on the service they provide.  I am really pleased with my PT results.  All the staff go out of their way to be helpful and involved with me.  I sincerely  recommend them."
I had a great experience. Scott and his assistants are very friendly and helpful. I felt confident in their knowledge and experience with my situation.
"Scott Lowe , Clinic Director , and his team of therapists are the ABSOLUTE BEST. My total knee replacement is the 2nd time I needed Scott and his team ! The  professionalism , and knowledge are outstanding ! They closely monitor my progress and develop plans accordingly. Patient service is a way of life for this team."
Excellent and friendly staff. Professional service. Luisa does a fantastic job. I highly recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy.
Scott and his staff are so friendly. They listen well which I value. Scott gives me hope for my chronic condition.
Everyone here is excellent. I feel lucky and grateful to have found this place.
Amazing staff that really helped me get back to where I needed to be with my arm. Highly recommend.
"I‚Äôll start by saying that even though there‚Äôs a Benchmark on almost every corner, I drive an hour to Scott Lowe‚Äôs East Woodstock clinic. Scott came highly recommended by my boss who has been with him for multiple recoveries and ended up exceeding my expectations.

He‚Äôs professional yet personal, kind and extremely knowledgeable of joint hypermobility/EDS (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome) and various ways to manage symptoms and pains while helping you prevent further injuries. The entire team at this location is very pleasant to work with and make visits enjoyable as they do their best to get to know you personally. :)"
"Claire, best therapist ever....well on the way to healing and in only two visits!"
The staff are all so friendly and they take time to listen to your needs.
I drive up from Buckhead to this location bc Dr Scott is the best PT in town. He‚Äôs kept me on the international platform (weightlifting) thru a quad injury and a rotator cuff injury. For sure couldn‚Äôt have stayed competing at this level without him.

"Good service when I needed physical therapy after I injured my knee, but then they waited a full year and a half after I received their services to bill me! I think this is extremely unprofessional and is just the latest in a number of poor professional services I have received from Emory Healthcare. If I can ever avoid using them, I do and will continue to avoid their services!"


"Just started therapy here but am really pleased with my therapist, Kelly Conley, PT. She is knowledgeable, open and friendly, and reassuring about meeting our goals. The center is easy to access, with free parking and a friendly staff."
She was very thorough in pointing out what I needed to do in order to be more flexible.
"Outstanding therapist. Anthony Meir has treated me for various conditions since 2003.
His knowledge and expertise is EXCELLENT"
"Anthony is very professional, gentle,
and knowledgeable when it comes to physical therapy. I really appreciate it.
I would definitely recommend this Emory facility for physical therapy."
"Very thorough, very professional."
I've always had an awesome time of re-habbing from this location staff is great and very friendly from. From the time u check in 2 the time u leave.  I truly feel that the staff has always had my best interest iat heart when it has come 2 my rehabilitation.
"Anthony Meier is knowledgeable, professional, friendly and knows how the body works and how to make it perform at it's best.  It's also helpful that he can make you smile while he's having you work hard.  I've only been to see him 4 times so far (shoulder injury) and I'm seeing and feeling positive results  already.  I learned of Anthony when my son injured his back in a car accident.  My son is back to great with no pills and no injections!  I wish I could give Anthony more than 5 stars."
"Emory Rehab Outpatient Center is truly great. The front office is friendly and competent. Anthony Meier is a first-rate physical therapist. In addition to my current spinal problem, I've had two knee replacements and have gone through a lot of therapy. Anthony is the best. I recommend him highly."
"After sharing details of my condition and answering some pertinent questions about my pain, Amanda recommended  several simple exercises to relieve the pain I was experiencing due to muscle spasms. This was quite a relief as sleeping was difficult. I look forward to any other tips that may allow me to return to as normal a life as possible. This is an excellent location for me and is staffed with professionals."
"Are you looking for a REHABILITATION OUTPATIENT CENTER?  The Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center is perfect, just what the Doctor ordered!  They have great Physical Therapist, who are professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and always on time.  The facility is clean and well equipped."
"My experience at Emory Rehab has been very successful! My Therapist Anthony has been AWESOME, and has made me feel much better from my very first visit. He loves his job and takes his time with you. If you come to the rehab you will definitely see results instantly especially with Anthony. Anthony provides great customer service, attention to detail, patience, great skills, great goal building ethics, very professional, leadership, and Awesome Awesome results.  Please give Anthony 10 stars and allow management and Emory to read the review.
Thanks Anthony!"
"My wife recently had a total hip replacement surgery. As part of her Outpatient Therapy we were referred to Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center.
We were blessed to have Katlin Nimm as our Physical Therapist. She has been a complete joy while working with my wife.
Answering all our questions in a very professional manner, and inspiring her on her journey back to doing day to day
activities. We highly recommend her  and this facility."
I have used this facility numerous times over the years and all of the therapist do a wonderful job of getting one back to normal functioning.
The facility is great and the people are very skilled and personable.  They are very accommodating. Nikita is a wonderful therapist.  She is very attentive to my needs.
"Jeff really should have 13 stars! He is intune with your therapy goals, compassionate, professional and encouraging every step of the way. First class environment. This has been my GO TO therapy office for many years and during all my rehab experiences. The entire staff in Decatur maintains a positive and helpful atmosphere. A great group of people with Anthony Meiser at the helm."
I like that they were able to accommodate me. Being that I don't wear pants. Some excercises I couldn't do out in the area with others. They have smaller rooms. And afterward I could go in the area with others and do the standing excercises.
This has  been a positive experience for me and my family.  I like their flexible scheduling. The therapists are very knowledgable and professional!
Very competent and caring staff.  I really like them all not just my therapist.
Excellent help with a good approach to customers and their understanding of physical therapy; highly recommended for therapy.
"The staff is super attentive, caring and nice!"
"These guys have been very helpful in helping with my back, it‚Äôs friendly atmosphere and would recommend it to anyone"
"Quality service, quality care"
"Nice facility, nice folks, knowledgeable too"


















"This place is amazing! The staff is so friendly and accommodating. They go above and beyond in every sense.
Mishal is incredible and everyone I have met have been so kind. I feel so much better since I started the physical therapy and now I have to tools to know what to do and how to do it. So worth it!"
BenchMark PT Lindbergh is a great location that I cannot recommend enough. They take the time to really help you through your issues and answer all of your questions. They care about their clients and make helping you a priority. I will definitely be back!!
"Great experience! The staff was welcoming and Alli is amazing. When I first started treatment I had no idea what to expect but she was very patient and attentive throughout my time at benchmark. Adjusting treatments when needed and recommending at home exercises or things that she thought would be beneficial. I‚Äôd recommend this location! I was so sad to be well again lol I miss this place. But most importantly, I am well thanks to Alli and her team."
"6 Stars! Alli and crew are phenomenal. I cannot say enough good things about the personalized support I received over the last few months. Breaking your leg sucks, but they did everything possible to get me back to walking, running, and jumping as quickly as possible. Their expertise is confidence inspiring, the facilities are clean, and they make a very un-fun recovery as enjoyable as possible. I hope to never need physical therapy again, but I would definitely return here or recommend this location to a friend."
"Allison at Lindbergh was super thorough with giving me new stretches and exercises for my mid back, in which I had been experiencing chronic pain since I had a vertebra fracture 3 years ago. The cupping and dry needling felt so good, too. Tiarra and all the staff there are very friendly to work with...highly recommend!"
I have suffered from a herniated disk in my back for years and tried physical therapy with minimal results years ago. I decided to try again recently with doctors orders. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much change but this time it was amazing. Allie was my PT and she‚Äôs phenomenal. After just 2 weeks I was feeling better and could see a huge difference. I have since gone for neck problems as well.  The office is amazing. Great staff and always welcoming!
I had injured my back twice in a year and was unable to function normally due to intense pain! I was referred to BenchMark Physical Therapist by one of my friends and Allie did an amazing job! She made me feel so comfortable and she immediately identified the area of pain even before I told her the spot. She taught me how to do some at home stretches and after just 8 sessions with her I was back to normal after a 1.5 years of suffering from chronic back pain. She would also explain why certain stretches would help. Would definitely recommend going here if you really want to get healed üôÇ
"Ali is amazing! I came here after a double foot injury and I could barely walk. I was so broken down mentally and physically, but after working with Ali, she got me back to almost 100%. I would recommend this place to anyone! Thank you to the Benchmark staff for being so accommodating."
"Wow! Five-star experience from the front desk coordinator to the physical therapy and the aesthetics of the building. I am blown away by the compassion and the effectiveness of my physical therapist, Alli. Her technique has saved my life. I am thoroughly pleased and will return without hesitation should my condition flare again.
~Chantel"
"I‚Äôm so thankful that I was able to find BenchMark PT! I came in with back pain that would not go away. While at BenchMark I was able to work with Alli, Stephanie, and Rakhee to manage my back pain. They all did such a wonderful job, and on top of that they were all super nice and supportive. I don‚Äôt know what I would‚Äôve done without this amazing team!! Thank you guys for everything!!!"
I‚Äôve had to recover from many different injuries in my young life. Katherine is the only therapist I have ever liked. She always made sure I was aware of why I was doing anything that she asked me to do. I‚Äôm very happy to have recovered but miss my three days a week working out with Katherine and the team.
I worked with Both Rakhee Patel and Allison Kuzma during my therapy. Both of them are very knowledgeable and helped me a great deal. They are keen listeners and dedicatedly worked around my schedule. Grateful for everything!
"Alli Kuzma treated me for severe pain as a result of a fall I had in July. Alli treated me with grest care and professionalism and has greatly alleviared my pain. Her assisstants Kenny and Maryanne provide a kind and friendly atmosphere also.
I highly recommend them for your treatment. Thanks to all of. you."
Alli and her team do a fantastic job!   I initially visited Alli after surgery on my left knee and she did such a great job I went back after having surgery on the right knee.  I found her treatments highly effective and she is extremely flexible with her schedule including accompanying me on one of my doctor's visits.   I highly recommend them!
"Alli and Kendall are amazing! I have unfortunately been to multiple physical therapists in the past and they have all been good, but Alli and Kendall are exceptional. I was in Alli's care for my neck, back, and knee. Alli is a very easy person to talk with and makes the sessions fly by. Some sessions were physically challenging but she was continuously encouraging and supportive. You get a personal feel here that I have not experienced at other places. You are not in a large room with six other physical therapists and their patients. Here, Alli is the only therapist with a couple tables and plenty of room for exercises. Kendall is an energetic  and kind hearted person. He jumped in on a few exercises with me and made them more fun. He was also very easy to communicate with and made the whole experience even better. I absolutely recommend that anyone who needs physical therapy come see Alli and Kendall."
"I can‚Äôt recommend this team enough! Everyone I got to know during my months of therapy‚ÄìAlli, Tiara, and Ravina‚Äìare all gems. Not only did they help me with my chronic neck pain, they also helped address my shoulder and back pain when they flared up as well. They do a great job of explaining things and trying to make sure you‚Äôre comfortable at all times throughout treatment.

In addition, they are genuinely friendly and caring people. Going to appointments felt like visiting a group of friends who want to help me feel better! I‚Äôm so glad that my neck pain has improved enough that I was able to be discharged, but I am going to miss seeing them each week."
This place is cool well I guess I made it cooler thanks for letting me make you guys day every other visit or so lol. well as far as physical therapy they are the best in town tell them Aaron sent you
"Ali and Kendall are fantastic! They are welcoming and make your time spent at this facility go by very quickly. Ali is very knowledgeable and takes her treatment programs very seriously. She makes you feel confident that you will get better after her suggested treatment. She is very hands on and always knows the right questions to ask so, she can pinpoint the areas of need. You would be lucky to have her as your therapist! Kendall is young and fun. He has great energy and makes your hour go by very quickly. I will stay in touch with these two after my program is completed because they are just good people! I'll miss seeing them weekly. Location is great and there is ample, covered parking."
"The team at this clinic is on point! I came in for my knee, which I've had frequent problems with over the years. Alli has helped me so much an in just a handful of weeks. I was able to enjoy a week of hiking in Colorado with little to no pain. Not to mention how much fun the clinic environment is! Ravina at the front desk is so friendly and will put a smile on your face as soon as you walk in. I definitely recommend this knowledgeable clinic staff!"
"I came to this BenchMark location after having ACL & Meniscus reconstruction surgery. Alli, Tiara and the rest of the staff were very knowledgable and helpful throughout the recovery process. They did a great job explaining what muscle groups each exercise targeted and how that would help with the recovery. My knee feels great now and highly recommend Alli and her team!"
"Alli is amazing! She takes her time to listen to you and to explain the treatment, step by step. She genuinely cares about each and every patient that walks in. I am so happy that I found her. I recommend her to everyone I know and is in need of physical therapy."
"Alli and Kendall provide top level therapy with extreme professionalism yet they are extremely personable! I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with my experience with them at Benchmark, and the level of therapy I received. Alli had me back in the gym just weeks after my shoulder surgery. I would highly recommend to anyone!"
Alli is great to work with.  She is very friendly and approachable and is a great therapist.  After many weeks of therapy and trying various techniques Alli has me finally back in shape and better. Thank you so much Alli.  I highly recommend her treatments and professionalism! A+
"Alli and Kendall are amazing! Alli is a wonderful physical therapist who gets to know you, your condition and lays out a plan to treat your personal injury. She is considerate and experienced and I highly recommend her. Kendall is a fantastic therapist assistant, who makes you feel welcome and greats you with a smile. A wonderful place!"
I've been going to Allie at Benchmark for years now for pain and weakness due to a spinal cord injury. The progress I've had here has been life changing and I feel lucky that I stumbled across this place because I've had physical therapists that weren't as knowledgeable or professional. Highly recommend.
"I hate to leave -- Ally and team are wonderful.   So empathetic and caring and a pleasure to be with.  Not to mention, they helped me get back on the tennis court.    They're the best"
"Alli Kuzma and Kendall are doing some amazing work here!
Alli is very knowledgeable and puts in the extra effort for the treatment. She understands her patients and their pain points well and customizes the exercises/treatment accordingly.
Kendall has also been amazing in demonstrating the exercises and accommodating schedule requests.
I would highly recommend them to anyone seeking physical therapy.  They also provide cupping and needle therapy if required to minimize the local pain."
"Alli is an amazing therapist. Not only does she create a comfortable and fun environment, she is able to fully understand and treat your issues. A genius! would recommend to all my friends and family!"
"Dr. Alli Kuzma is wonderful! I came to her, in tears I was in so much pain, expecting yet another doctor who had never heard of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. I was so pleasantly surprised. Not only had she heard of my condition, she has other patients with it and a family member, so she really knew what I was talking about and going through. She did not minimize my experience or make me feel crazy. She hugged me and helped me, and even assisted me with applying for a low-income rate so that I could get the attention I needed. She answered all of my questions, and told me the names of all of the specific muscles and areas where the pain was so that I could understand what was happening to my body. She helped my pain significantly, and gave me exercises to take with me once my sessions were complete. I would recommend her to anyone, especially if you have EDS and are at the end of your rope - you have an ally in Dr. Kuzma!"
"Ali is so great work with, such a helpful therapist and so personable! It really is a journey of walking through issues with your body with discomfort, pain, and healing, and I never felt unsupported in it with her. She‚Äôs a dry needling superwoman! HIGHLY recommend! I feel I lucked out in finding her!"
Allison and her team did an outstanding job and were extremely  knowledgeable and professional. They were always more than willing to help and were very personal in helping me fulfill my goals. Her team exceeded my expectations in every category and I would highly recommend them to anyone seeking physical therapy.
"I highly recommend Alli Kuzma and Benchmark Physical Therapy at Lindbergh in Atlanta!  Alli is very knowledgeable and experienced in various techniques but more importantly, she explains what she is doing and what result to expect.

I have a chronic shoulder and back issue along with plantar fasciitis so Alli has worked on various body parts.  She instructs me in the way to do the exercise during my session and also how to modify some exercises to do at home or during a workout.  Alli is very thorough!  This Benchmark office is setup very well and is well equipped for different strategies depending on the body part.

Alli is very strong in doing Dry Needling.  She also effectively performs Graston, spinal manipulation and cupping.  She often does a variety of these procedures on different days to get my body to react and start healing. Along with the structured exercises, the dry needling on most days and the heat and ice at the end, I always feel better when I have an appointment with Alli at Benchmark.

Alli's staff is also very efficient, welcoming and caring.  It's a good atmosphere to be in while doing physical therapy.  The Lindbergh location is also ideal and easy to park and get to and they have very flexible hours.  Thanks, Alli and Team!"
"Wow, I've been here quite a few times over the past couple of years for my ankle, elbow and knee. My knee injury actually happened back in 2015/2016 and never really got it right after an ACL and meniscus tear.

The past few months I've been rehabbing my elbow and Alli also helped me work on my hip/leg strength. I brought up concerns that my knee would swell up every time I ran or was on my legs for awhile. I started out running 1/2 miles and I'm pleased to say I'm running 5 miles at 7:45/mile pace  now with little/no discomfort and little swelling. Prior I had PT's tell me to work on my hip strength but they never explained why it was important. Alli will get you there if you're diligent doing your workouts! I also started doing dry needling for my elbow and knee and I think it helps. My ankle, elbow, and knee are doing great now thanks to the Alli and the staff here at benchmark Lindbergh!

For some reason this location doesn't come up as in network on BCBS's website but it's in network! Location is convenient and right across from the Marta station. There's also 2 Pok√©mon spots you can hit if you're still trying to catch them all."
"Alli is very knowledgeable and takes the time to customize each exercise to my ability, comfort, and goals."
"Absolutely wonderful staff and facility in a very convenient location! Alli really knows her stuff. I came to BenchMark for physical therapy after having ACL reconstruction surgery. While there, I was challenged without feeling pushed beyond comfort. I regained strength and flexibility and am now able to participate in a regular fitness regiment without issue. When I was in pain, Alli was quick to diagnose the root cause and help me work it out with a combination of dry needling, cupping, stretching, and massage. I would highly recommend this facility (and have done so to two personal friends that tore their ACLs)."
Affordable with and with insurance. They are dry needle and cupping pros
"Awesome experience, I really love this place. My therapist Will is amazing, if you're gonna be injured which sucks you might as well go see them so they can get you back in a hurry."



"Jace, Jennifer and the entire staff are awesome. Miss you guys. I will be back, if I ever need physical therapy again. Thumbs up and a high five!!!!!"
"I had my hip replaced in January 2021. The staff at this facility are wonderful. They made my wife and I feel comfortable the minute we walked through the door. Not only was the therapy top notch, the overall experience was uplifting and always positive. I felt truly blessed to be surrounded by such a dedicated team!"
"My mother just finished PT here, and she loved everyone!  Jace and Jennifer were super helpful!"
"My mother just finished her PT here.  Much thanks to everyone, including Jace and Jennifer!"
"I had a terrific experience at Benchmark, what a great bunch of people! I enjoyed the fun and friendly atmosphere! A special thank you to Jace for getting me back to where I needed to be. Thanks everyone"
Excellent location for therapy.  I'm 6 weeks post knee surgery and Jayce did an excellent job in my rehabilitation.  Everyone in the office is friendly and professional.  Definitely will use them again.
Felt like family here! Jace helped me get back on my feet with a broken lower leg. He listened to my concerns and helped me push my way to healing! Will miss yall! Thank you for everything! I will definitely refer everyone your way!
Jace and team are very caring and attentive to your specific situation and beyond.  Good and consistent COVID practices and protocols in place.
"Are there more than 5 stars? This is a place where I found not only physical healing but also emotional! Coming from a deep depression and a car wreck, I was treated by Jace for about 6 months for my lower back and leg pain and now I'm back for a left rotator cuff injury. The environment is a blessing. They are all highly professional, knowledgeable and compassionate, oh and very musical. I'm in love with all of them: Jenny, Chelsie, Jace, Rigo and Mr Jared. I just have a question is Mr. Jared  a baritone or a bass? I hope you don't need PT but if you do, please, give them a try."
"The therapist and staff are very supportive and caring. Are blessed that they are in our back yard, always ready to help. Thank you for putting me back on the right road. üíñ"
"I am a patient at Benchmark Traditions and extremely pleased with my experience. Not only are the personnel friendly but are very knowledgeable. I‚Äôm making progress just as my Dr. expected.

The atmosphere is very friendly, encouraging and filled with conversation and laughter. The music is always relaxing and at a pleasurable volume.

I will definitely recommend THIS facility to my family and friends. If needed, I will not hesitate to return for more therapy!

Tammy Walker"
"I go to Benchmark at Traditions because the staff is so friendly, kind and really care about you. They make me feel comfort and like I really belong. The therapist I see is concerned and takes all the time I need. The place is clean and convenient. I have gone there in the past and I‚Äôm going again. I tell everyone I know to go there. Keep up the awesome work."
"I am the wife of a patient that is in that period of not being able to drive for a few weeks.  I  observe a lot.  The professional staff is a team, they make us feel welcome, even tho we are going post my husband's surgery, it is not something we just have to do.  They make this as good an experience as it can possibly be.  The front desk person, Jenny, makes us feel like she is genuinely interested in everyone's outcome.  I have watched her welcome new patients and say good by to someone who was finished with their therapy.  Fortunately, we don't have a lot of experience with physical therapy, but I would absolutely recommend them in a heartbeat.  GREAT JOB!!!!!"
"I am currently on my second round of physical therapy at Traditions Benchmark, and I wouldn‚Äôt want to go anywhere else. Jared and all of the staff there are great! Not only are they knowledgeable and professional, they will keep you laughing while you work! Jenny always greets you with a smile, and is super accommodating when it comes scheduling appointments. I highly recommend this clinic."
"I highly recommend BenchMark Physical Therapy!!!  They truly care and create treatments unique to each person.  I thoroughly enjoyed each and every visit.  They make physical therapy fun and enjoyable for everyone.

I do not know what I would do without my BenchMark Physical Therapy family.  I tore my first ACL in high school, and they helped me get back on the field ASAP to finish out my senior year.  I continued to have issues with my knees throughout my soccer career.  I went straight back to Jared and everyone at BenchMark because I knew they would get me back on the field doing what I loved.  BenchMark Physical Therapy made PT fun and enjoyable.  I laughed and had fun at every visit, and I never left without a smile on my face.  I was in the best shape of my life physically and mentally after completing physical therapy with them.  They go above and beyond to make sure you are mentally confident and physically ready to do whatever you want to do on a daily basis.  I am forever grateful to my BenchMark Physical Therapy family, and I truly do not know what I would do without them."
"I am a patient at the Benchmark Traditions location.  The staff and therapists are extremely knowledgeable, accommodating and friendly.  They truly care about the patients recovery and wellbeing.  They take extra time to listen, evaluate and plan a care of treatment specifically for each patient.  I was nervous about going at first, but they always made me feel at ease. I highly recommend all of the therapists, Jarrad, Jase and Jenny! You will feel right at home when you meet the sweet and helpful Jenny who greets you with her big smile as soon as you first walk through the door!!"
I credit the excellent therapy I received from this wonderful crew for my successful recovery from not just one knee replacement but two. The individual attention and exercises developed specifically for my issues ensured my full recovery and during times that I struggled the staff encouraged me and would not let me give up or quit. Now I walk without any problems with my gait and often forget that my knees are not original equipment. There always lively discussions going on between the therapists and clients which everyone was encouraged to participate in. It was fun as well as informative and often made clients forget their pain for a while. I highly recommend Benchmark Traditions and especially Jared.
I like Benchmark at Traditions for many reason. The guys and girls treat you like family. They are kind and make you feel comfort. They are always in high spirits. Th place is clean. My therapist takes my problems very serious. I have gone to them in the past and will continue to go. Thank you staff.
"The staff at Benchmark Traditions are absolutely amazing! They are very uplifting and caring, which makes the Physical Therapy process much more pleasant. I had recently had a car accident and attribute my healing to their therapy and encouragement to continue exercise and stretches at home. They‚Äôre the BEST in the West Jackson/Jefferson Area!"
"I came into the BenchMark clinic in Traditions in a wheelchair after extensive surgery on my ankle.  Through their expertise I have progressed to walking with minor assistance.  I am confident that my gait and stability will continue to improve in the remaining weeks of therapy.  The staff is wonderful.  My physical therapist, Jared, (along with Jenny, Nikki and Jace) have made this challenging time better with their encouragement and the positive,  joyful atmosphere.  I highly recommend this clinic."
I used this clinic after having knee issues/surgery. The staff is great! All of them are very knowledgeable and make therapy fun. I would recommend Benchmark Traditions to anyone needing therapy.
"The staff here is awesome!!!, Jenny-the receptionist, keeps up with both appointments and up-to-date with scheduling allowing me to adjust life as well as updating doctor's notes, Jenny and Nicki, my therapists keeps the routines real and rigorous but allows for acclamation by constantly noting and documenting any issues both positive and negative, thus far all of my required as well as personal goals have been accomplished.  Jarrod, the director, is both professional as well as entertaining as he often sings as he works but is serious as he insures the best therapy by design."
"An absolutely fantastic and qualified staff where you will receive top notch care. I went for several weeks to receive treatment for a hip issue that nagged me for a year, and enjoyed the friendly and professional environment while I made a steady recovery. I can‚Äôt recommend them enough!"
"Benchmark Therapy was key in my recovery from hip and knee surgery.  Jared was excellent with his expertise in the field of physical therapy.  His knowledge, kind spirit and encouragement was so contagious and helped me to realize that recovery is a possibility!  Thank you to everyone at Benchmark Traditions - it was a true pleasure and blessing to get to know you all."
"Just wanted to say ""Thank You"" to everyone that works @ BenchMark Traditions. During the last 6 weeks each of you have given me friendly and professional care with my physical therapy and made me feel comfortable. There are other clinics closer to our house but I felt best here at this location. I would highly recommend this location for anyone needing physical therapy.
Bonnie Dills"
"The physical therapists are experienced and work hard to fulfill your goals.  Their attitude towards all patients is caring and kind.
They are knowledgeable and make your experience fun while getting your body back to where it needs to be.  I highly recommend this business to all."
Benchmark PT Traditions is amazing! All of the staff will go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and they treat you like family. I strongly recommend this location. You will not be disappointed!
"Have been bringing my wife to therapy for several weeks since she had knee replacement.
Staff has been very good and made us very comfortable. Even though I was just waiting in the wings, I could see the care they were taking with my wife. I would recommend this facility to anyone who would like a little fun mixed in with their therapy.
Wayne Dills"
Benchmark is a great friendly place for rehab. Jared did a excellent job helping me recover from knee surgery. Could have got back to work nearly as fast as I did with out him!
"Welcome home! BenchMark Traditions is a place where you will feel welcome from the moment you step through the doors, to the time you complete your therapy. I have been to BenchMark several times for sports related injuries and post surgical rehabilitation, and I would highly recommend them. They have challenged me as much or as little as I needed, and gotten me back in action feeling great! All of the therapists and employees are helpful and caring. Jared, the clinic director, is friendly, and the clinic is usually full of laughter in a family environment. Jared's beard should get an honorable mention seeing as it takes a dedicated and patient man to grow such an elegant beard. Jared and his beard are a combination of ZZ Top and Chuck Norris, so round house kick the pain away, and let BenchMark Traditions treat you today!"
I love everyone here!! They are nothing but nice and brighten my day Everytime I walk in the door. I include them as friends and this therapy place a huge silly family. I want to say a HUGE thank you to all of the employees at this location. Couldn't be more blessed to of been assigned to this location and to be able to work and get better with these wonder amazing therapist's. Much love to every last one of y'all.

I want to thank everyone at Benchmark Traditions for helping me feel better.  Not only do they help you physically but they make you feel at home.  I highly recommend this place.
"BenchMark Physical Therapy has been a tremendous help to me over the past 5 or so years.  The experience of the staff is second to none from Shoulder, Knee, Back, Wrist and Bicep surgeries that they have helped me fully recover from.  I can't say enough about them."
The folks at Benchmark Traditions are the best. Jared is very professional and proficient.  Jenny always has a welcoming smile and keeps everyone scheduled for their next appointments.
The staff are amazing. Very conforming and attentive. My family has been blessed by their professional and personal attention.  Thank you for helping us ...
I absolutely love Benchmark Traditions! You are treated like family as soon as you walk in. I would not go anywhere else for my physical therapy. I highly recommend Benchmark Traditions!
"Love these guys, they do wonderful work and I feel like the reason I‚Äôve recovered so quickly is due to them. Also love the whole staff!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Jared is an amazing pt. I saw him for my shoulder and knee and he always made sure I was exceeding my best. I would recommend anyone to him!
Jared and his staff are the best and have hearts of gold! Customer service is their priority and their love for patient care is evident from the moment you walk in.

I wouldn't go anywhere else, Jenny is a blessing always greets everyone with a SMILE and cares about the patients.  The entire staff is Awesome!!!!  They make you feel like you are family....Love my Benchmark family...Larry Swann (RTR)"
The staff is amazing - all friendly.  The staff clearly stays up to date on the latest physical therapy trends.  They are all very knowledgeable.
I have enjoyed coming to BenchMark! Jenny and Jace are great!! They are always fun and smiling. I would recommend this place for any PT services.
Benchmark therapists all take excellent care of their patients.  They are very professional and strive for the successful rehilibation of each client.
This is the Best Physical Therapy clinic around. The atmosphere at the clinic is welcoming and staff is so friendly. If you are in need of therapy this is the clinic for you.
"Benchmark physical therapy traditions has taken care of my kids, following surgery, for the past couple of years. I‚Äôve been to other locations, but will not go anywhere else except Benchmark Traditions. Great staff!"
I love this clinic and the staff there.  I recommend them to all my family and friends.  They care.
First visit today. Very attentive therapists. Great staff. Looking forward to my full recovery.
"Jared and his team at Benchmark are second to none. Professionalism, hospitality, and excellence describe the experience you will have."
"My mom started going here for therapy & can I just say Is really positive work place, From what I experience being there is  friendly staff & welcoming"
"My experience after hip and knee replacement has been excellent.  The staff is fabulous and Jarad, my go to therapist, is amazing at handling my odd issues and making me feel wonderful again."
"The details of my experience at benchmark physical therapy, traditions, is that of an experience that would be described as a bald eagle flying over crystal blue waters, nestled in the crisp glacial mountains of anywhere on the North America continent where such a thing might and likely has been witnessed by a patriot, God bless America."
The staff is great ! I had a total knee replacement and they're awesome in getting me back to full strength!
Highly recommend Benchmark Traditions PT. You will feel better in no time and the employees make the experience fun.
Benchmark Traditions is great and my therapist Nicki was very patient and professional and helped me regain use of my knee. Thank you Benchmark!
I have never been to a PT clinic that cares about their patients as much as the Traditions Benchmark PT clinic.  I am so thankful God put them in my life.
Love working with Jared and his team. Great customer service and treatment!
This clinic is a family! They support you and welcome you with open arms. Getting well and strong is fun and enjoyable.
This place is excellent. And Jared has the most epic beard

üëçüèª























































Extremely professional. Clean and organized environment. Staff super helpful. Definitely military friendly. Highly recommend
"They are really a fantastic team that's very caring. They work with you to establish goals. I've worked with Cloe, Sarah and now Drew. They all are great and Sarah is fantastic with dry needling as well. I couldn't be more pleased with my progress."
Everyone here is super sweet! It was my first time having to do something like this and Drew was amazing! He thoroughly explained the process and what our goals were for each session. I am very happy with my results and will always recommend this location to anyone!
"My therapy is completed and I feel so much better. It helped tremendously. Clho√® was phenomenal. She was so knowledgeable and professional. She knew exactly was she was doing and I am so grateful.

The Staff is super friendly and kind. They treat you with respect and human dignity.

Thank You for everything!"
"Some things a person wants to end, but when a patient has professionals analyzing, treating, explaining, and encouraging you to give 100% because the therapists do, you have the perfect physical therapy environment. This is what I found at Benchmark from the smiling face that greets and bids you farewell to the several therapists and trainees who really care snd push you to gain strength. I am so thankful for all the help and encouragement."
"The Benchmark staff are attentive to your needs and goals. Each therapist demonstrates unique talents, skills, patience and sense of humor to get the patients to achieve their goals. Including this Occupational Therapist!!"
I received treatment for my migraines with Sarah and could not have been more pleased. Every interaction with all the staff here has been magnificent. I recommend this facility to everyone.
They have been so helpful strengthening my neck and my hip. And I highly recommend the dry needling.
"I saw Nicole at Benchmark in Richmond Hill for pelvic floor therapy. She and her staff were amazing! After only 4 sessions, I saw drastic improvements to my hip and pelvic floor muscles. They not only work with you on the physical part, but also educate you on why and how you began to experience issues in the first place. Nicks and her team are the best!"
"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about Nicole and her staff at Benchmark in RH. I‚Äôve been a patient off and on for 2 years, for back and shoulder therapy, both post surgery. Nicole gives me her undivided attention, pays attention to my issues/concerns, all while pushing me for some more ROM or holding a plank a little longer! You get Nicole for the whole hour, she just doesn‚Äôt give you a list of exercises to do and then leaves you on your own. Stephanie is always so pleasant when you walk in. I couldn‚Äôt imagine going anywhere else for PT. I highly recommend Benchmark  for all your PT needs!"
"The ladies here in Richmond Hill are fabulous! Far exceeded my expectations in a short time. I‚Äôm able to return to work six weeks after my total knee replacement surgery. They are kind, caring and compassionate. I would not go anywhere else. They‚Äôre the best!"
This place is amazing ! Everyone there is super professional and friendly . I was in pt for over a year and truly enjoyed my time there. They really helped me through all of my issues and made me feel like a million bucks. This place is highly recommend!
"Have received excellent PT here from Sarah and her great team! Sarah is top notch, very thorough, listens to all my concerns then addresses them competently. I was so apprehensive about addressing my chronic back pain, but she is sooo good at what she does. She put me at ease and has really helped my quality of life improve! Can't say enough about how awesome this place is. If you have pain and are willing to do the work( carefully evaluated, educated and guided), you are missing the boat by not getting physical therapy here with Sarah."
I cannot say enough good things about Benchmark Physical Therapy. Tammy is friendly and accommodating when making appointments and I would recommend Nicole to anyone in need of a physical therapist. She worked with me on my knee and sciatic pain and rehabilitated my knee after surgery. She was thorough in her assessments and helped me to set goals that were individualized for me and obtainable. I feel she pushed me when I needed it and backed off on the days when I was struggling. I‚Äôm very happy with the care I received there and the progress I made because of it.
"This facility is the size of a living room.  It was over crowded, and the staff were more interested in talking over one another about posh Mark, weddings and other personal topics than in treating the patients.  Not only was this facility not run professionally, it appeared to lack basic privacy, equipment, competent or committed physical therapists."
Very thorough in helping alleviate my pain
Great PTs.  Incredible Telehealth experience. Highly recommend.
"I had a wonderful experience at BenchMark in Richmond Hill! Nicole and her staff are phenomenal and efficient at what they do. I unfortunately had two separate injuries in the same year and ended up in therapy for both of these injuries. The staff focused on personalizing my therapy to meet my goals. When my therapy sessions were complete, I was back to my daily activities and workouts at 100%!"
"I had a pretty rough back injury at work. Physician recommended Benchmark. I'm glad I went there for PT. A few weeks of excellent care and top notch instruction got rid of my back pain almost entirely. After that, I followed the home workouts they gave me and now my back is better than it was before the injury. They treat all of their clients professionally and with extreme care, almost like they're family. I recommend Benchmark in Richmond Hill for anyone who needs physical therapy. The staff is super friendly, and they were able to put up with my sense of humor, which says a lot. 10/10, would use again, but at the same time I hope u never have to!

Quick edit: Tammy was wonderful, I mainly worked with Nicole who was amazing, and unfortunately I forgot the names of the others but they we're all outstanding as well"
"Nicole is the best ever.  I had been to a orthopedic doctor twice and had a xray and MRI, but didn't feel they understood the issue i was having with my shoulder.  During my first appointment Nicole pinpointed exactly what the issue was and started my treatment.  After only 2 appointments i feel 1,000% better and definitely feel like I'm on the right course."
"I would recommend this facility to others needing PT‚Ä¶ Dr. Nicole is very skilled, with an impressive bedside manner (a lost art, unfortunately, in today's world of medical care)."
"When you walk in the door,< Tammy greets you with such a humorous expression for the day and always keeps you smiling and laughing while you are getting physically fit and brought back to where you should be.  Each staff member is awesome"
Dr. Nicole and Tammy are wonderful to work with.  They easily accommodate my schedule and really listen to all of my concerns and questions about my treatment.
Outstanding place to have Physical therapy


"My wife and I have both been coming to see Pavel throughout most of the year. His professionalism and bedside manners make you never want to fully heal and need to stop coming. We are both truly grateful for the the entire team at this benchmark location. They uplift your physical and mental health with their positive attitude and patient focused care.

Thank you Pavel, Kellie Ann, and Austin!"
"Very impressed with the outcome after my treatment.
Pavel Gorokhov and Austin Cushing are excellent therapists. They are very pleasant. I highly recommend them. They are able to do their job so well with a great help from Kelly Anne Estes.
I am a retired Physiatrist- Physical Medicine and Rehab Physician. I have prescribed PT for most of my patients. This is the first time, I was treated by PT and I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome.
I am able to WALK AGAIN!"
"I have had an amazing experience here. All the staff are genuinely nice, and interesting to talk to. It‚Äôs an engaging and enjoyable atmosphere. I usually dread things like this, but I really didn‚Äôt mind coming in multiple times a week at all."
"I was referred to the Benchmark location around 10 weeks ago with some complicated nerve, muscle and skeletal issues. Pavel and his team have been responsive, professional and results oriented throughout. The service is personalized to specifically targeted to my addressing my specific issues. After each session, I have experienced good progress to the point that much of my pain has dissipated. Thanks to the entire team for their dedication and to Pavel on his leadership and focus. Great work and I would highly recommend them!"
I can‚Äôt say enough good things about Pavel and the team at Benchmark! Always courteous and professional in their dealings with clients. I was treated for tennis elbow and it was suggested I try dry needling and I‚Äôll just say that was a game changer for my recovery. I highly recommend Benchmark and will definitely go there again should the need arise.
"I was a patient at Benchmark from Mid February through the first week of June. Worked with several therapist and received excellent care and instruction.
As with most businesses, your impressions are built by the first person you meet. This is certainly the case at this clinic. Always courteous and friendly.
The entire staff takes pride in what they do and do everything to make clients feel like family.
If you are looking for excellent care and service, this is the location for you."
"After one session, my foot felt better than it had in the months after my surgery.  Pavel is a miracle worker and truly cares about his patients. Not just their physical well being, but he gets to know you, about your family and your interests. He understands people have a life outside of their recovery and he does what he can to make sure your physical therapy fits in.  He and Kelly Ann have really fostered a wonderful community in their location and I look forward to going every time."
"I and my husband both have been visiting this Benchmark PT location.  I feel like Pavel has got special powers to get his  patient‚Äôs current situation before you enter into the building. :) . His experience and sense of humor is awesome ! He connects and you feel special. I am sad that my surgeon has asked me to reduce the number of weekly visits!Kelle Ann, Austin and Pavel makes an awesome team and keep patient‚Äôs motivated and entertained. They totally extend their services to work on your mental health and not just physical therapy and exercises! I am usually lazy for posting reviews but this awesome team  definitely needs appreciation and congratulations on the services that they offer!!!"
"Best Physical Therapy experience I have ever had. Dr. Pavel, Kala and Kelli Ann are the BEST. I was experiencing ""extreme"" vertigo and vestibular problems (post Covid) for more than 5 months. Pavel patiently worked with me for several months. He was always making sure that whatever procedure he was doing, that I was safe, doing okay and able to perform the exercises without getting too dizzy. When Pavel wasn't available, Kala jumped right in and took over my care.

Kelli Ann is amazing and makes sure everything in this office runs likes it should - from scheduling to insurance and beyond!

Everyone there is professional and friendly. They get to ""know you"" and make you feel that you are not just a patient, but they really do care about you and your health.

I recommend this place 100% and if Pavel and his team ever moves locations - I'm going to follow them!"
"I would highly recommend this location to all my friends and family. They truly go above and beyond to make you feel better. Pavel is a fantastic therapist. He is very knowledgeable about all the different treatment options that are available. He makes you feel at ease from the moment you walk in the door. He takes the time to really listen to any concerns that you have, explain in detail your treatment plan, and fully answer any questions you have. Kelly and is awesome as well. She is so warm and friendly from the moment you walk in the door. She‚Äôs so easy to work with when scheduling your appointments and will do anything she can to accommodate your schedule. I never feel rushed when I‚Äôm here and always leave feeling confident I received the best possible care for my recovery. I will definitely be using this location for all of my physical therapy needs."
"Received a referral from my Dr for PT. Not an option I had tried before.  I was REALLY happy that this BenchMark Therapy  was close. Also, was REALLY hoping this PT would work, because other options for my issues were NOT  optimal. PT, with Patel, actually helped more than I expected. It hasn‚Äôt shaved years off of my age‚Ä¶, but it has helped immensely with the issues that brought me here. And truthfully, I KNOW, I would drive farther to work with Pavel, because his knowledge/ experience is never taxed, his professionalism is ever present, and he treats me as individual, knowing enough of my story to properly help me.
I would be remiss to not Kellie Ann, as she is so helpful in so many ways to mention all of them,  but I must write, she never makes me feel bad when I have to alter my schedule.  Recently Austin joined the duo, and he great, too.
Thank you for reading."
"Great Team of Pros! From my first contact with Benchmark Physical Therapy the care and service I have received is fantastic.  The office is run very efficiently, making appointments is is quick and easy and Katie Ann is very pleasant and helpful.  Pavel is a top-notch professional as well as being very personable and easy to talk to.  He is meticulous in asking pertinent questions relating to my discomfort or restrictions in mobility experienced between sessions.  The therapy he provides me  is very effective in relieving my symptoms and he explains everything so I am able to understand the problem, the cause of the problem, and why he prescribes the particular exercises.  I look forward to coming for each session! I highly recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy."
"Pavel, Kayla and Kellann are all very professional and an outstanding staff. I received excellent physical therapy that helped heal my body. In addition, I felt very much at ease and had a great time. I hope you will choose them for your physical therapy! Thanks guys!"
"There is not enough praise and recommendations to truly express how professional and kind-hearted the team is at Benchmark Physical Therapy at Oak Farm Dr. Following a difficult realization of two likely necessary surgeries, I stumbled across this location for routine post-op physical therapy. I could not have been more lucky to meet the wonderful duo that runs this location, Pavel and Kellie Ann. Pavel, the physical therapist, is extremely thorough and genuinely listens to your concerns, fears, and questions. He truly goes above and beyond for all of his patients. They make you feel very comfortable in a setting where patients are typically in pain and frustrated. Pavel has helped me feel hopeful about my recovery and provides me with daily feedback and exercises. He is easy to contact via phone or email and truly explains the how's and why's. Every session feels like one-on-one care. Kellie Ann is a joy to be around and makes coming to physical therapy fun, comfortable, and easy. She is very easy to work with in terms of scheduling, payments, or any general questions. I will refer anyone and everyone to this Benchmark PT location. I am so grateful that I found Pavel and Benchmark PT."
Top of the line care!  This location of benchmark has a two person team.  Pavel and Kelly Ann.  During my physical therapy treatment plan they took care of me like family.  The care and concern they put into each patient will make your treatment and recovery period feel like a ‚Äúretreat‚Äù instead of chore.  They taught me so much on how to take care of myself in and out of physical therapy so that I could heal and get the best results possible.  If ever I need physical therapy again this will be my go to team/place!  Every medical office should strive for this level of care and excellence for their patients.
Pavel is an amazing Physical Therapist who genuinely cares for his patients. They are as accommodating as possible when scheduling appointments. I could not recommend them more highly
"This Benchmark physical therapy location  is an Excellent facility, very clean, sanitary and all the equipment and furniture are new
The staff is very knowledgeable, professional,
polite  and are experience in a wide range of therapy

Thank you to my physical therapist Pavel Gorokhov and support staff
I‚Äôve been fortunate to received care from the best so here‚Äôs to you guys."
"Pavel and Kelly Ann were 2 of the sweetest people I have ever met. On a day that I wasn't able to go to my appointment, they called to check up on me to see if I was feeling ok. Pavel did a great job really trying to get to the root of my back issues. He was very transparent about why he was doing the exercises and how it was to help me. They were very diligent about keeping everything clean and sanitized throughout my session.  Please call them for your PT needs."
"Wow!! what a great experience I'm having at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Alpharetta. Pavel is the best!! He has helped me tremendously with my neck pain and I can't say enough good things about him and the services he provides. Not only am I feeling so much better overall, I am able to work longer hours without pain and finally, I wake up each day pain-free.  He and Kelly Ann make me feel welcomed and part of the family at each and every appointment. Highly recommend if you are having pain and are wanting your life back!! Oh...and the spa like pampering is incredible.
2 thumbs up"
Pavel is professional and personable. He works with you in a friendly manner to accomplish your goals. Kelly Ann is amazing and  willing to work with you when your schedule may require a change.
Best Physical Therapy place you ever find. Paval is very intelligent and caring and exactly knows what he is doing to make his patient feel comfortable. Few of my family member including myself is been going for therapy for few weeks now and i must say that we are more than please with the results we are getting. His staff is also very friendly and loving. I highly recommend this place for anyone needing any kind of Physical Therapy.
"I had never had therapy before but after a back injury, I had no choice. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but thanks to Pavel and his tech, I truly believe I‚Äôll be not only back to my pre injury self, but better. I have also had the opportunity to not only receive treatment from him but to see him treat others and his knowledge and true dedication to his job made me come back for a serious hand treatment as well. At this point I couldn‚Äôt imagine getting treated elsewhere. I‚Äôm truly grateful for his attention to detail and total body knowledge."
"Professional, personable and effective! I highly recommend the McFarland BenchMark location. Pavel and Kelly Ann are an amazing team and provide top notch care. If you need physical therapy this is the place to go."
"I followed Pavel and his office manager Kellie Ann from their previous Benchmark location in Roswell (which is also great).  Pavel is the definition of a caring therapist, always willing to go above and beyond for his patients.  Most people think of a PT only as someone who gives you exercises to do.  Pavel also does massage, dry needling, cupping and other alternative therapies.  I have a chronic condition which will require a lifetime of PT and that lifetime will all be done at this clinic."
"Had a wonderful experience here as I‚Äôve been dealing with my shoulder pain.
Dr. Pavel is very professional, he listens and understands...trully caring and passionate.
The best place for physical therapy
Dr. Pavel and Kelly Ann are the best!!!! GREAT TEAM!!"
"We love this facility and team! Our 8 year old had balance issues stemming from a problem at birth. Even though this facility isn't specifically a kids' facility, Pavel worked so well with our kiddo. She gained tons of confidence and finally achieved her dream of riding a bike without training wheels."
"Pavel is amazing, friendly and kind physical therapist that only want to assist his patients in healing and having better life with less pain.
Kellyann is awesome up front in greeting everyone and making sure they are taken care of before see Pavel.
The facility is new and is great location and atmosphere."
"I was looking in particular for a physical therapist for vestibular therapy. I am so thankful to have found Pavel. He is a caring, conscientious therapist who has given me hope about my balance issues. I was so discouraged prior to finding him. Kelly Ann is always cheerful and kind."
Dr. Pavel and Kellie Anne are fantastic. Super nice and great at what they do! 10/10 recommend this for your physical therapy!
"Pavel is the best! This is my second rotator cuff surgery (different shoulders) and had PT somewhere else for the 1st one and it is night and day difference. 5 stars doesn't do him justice!!!! I highly recommend him and this location, you won't regret it!"
"Pavel Gorokhov, the Clinical Director at the McFarland Parkway location, is wonderful.  His expertise has helped me a lot.  Highly recommended."
"I started with Benchmark in March of last year. I am going on almost 1 year with Pavel Gorokhov and Kellyann. I am delighted to say my experience with my Physical Therapist has been the best. I will refer anyone to Pavel over at Benchmark in Alpharetta. Pavel. I am almost finish with my Physical Therapy. I am going to miss you and Kellyann. I look forward to seeing you guys every week, you have became a part of me like family, my leaving will be bitter sweet, but I know, I can‚Äôt stay forever. I looked forward to Kellyann beautiful smile, telling me how happy she is to see me. I will miss Pavel pushing me to my limits, telling me I can do this.
I will miss him saying to his patients, when we are there on a Wednesday, asking us, what day is it guys( he always says it‚Äôs Friday). He knows how to make us laugh, even when we are in pain, and trying our hardest. Pavel, you and Kellyann are my rock. I love you guys for all the great laughs, and always making my day so bright, even on a rainy day.... from my heart to you all. I will miss you guys! You are the best. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Benchmark is getting me up and going.  I am able to go to work afterwards with minimal pain.  Love you Guys you are the bestüß°üß°üß°
"Dr. Pavel Gorokov did a great job helping my girlfriend rehabilitate her knee. He is easy to work with, knowledgeable, and has great manners."
Pavel Gorokhov is an awesome physical therapist! Very skillful and is extremely encouraging to his clients. I highly recommend him!
Pavel Gorokhov is great to work with and always  positive with his approach. He knows how to treat his patients. Kelly Anne and Pavel are a great team!!
"If you are in need of physical therapy I highly recommend this location, you get incredible service, caring staff and people who are on a mission to help you meet your goals."
Pavel He's a best physical therapist kellyanne she's super friendly every time  i highly recommend this location is the best location.
Kelly Ann and Pavel have provided over exceedingly expectations as well as customer service with friendly encouragment to help me overcome my disabilities. Excellent!!!!
I suggest to everyone don‚Äôt use Piedmont Walton Physical Therapy at the hospital.They do not know what they are doing as I had a horrible experience there.The physical therapist needs to retire she pulled my arm way to far back outward and cracked my shoulder and now it‚Äôs been 5.5 months and I still haven‚Äôt finished my therapy simply because She got in a big hurry.When I first started therapy a women walked in and said to the therapist that Dr Harken doesn‚Äôt like the progress with the therapy your giving me and he told me to go else where.
I‚Äôve been to many many different physical therapy places in my life. I feel like PT solutions and their staff is by far the most professional and top-notch.. I really mean it I would never say it if I didn‚Äôt mean it. They are very well trained and they work you hard but you get results.!!!
Awesome staff and friendly environment. My mom gets the best care possible with every visit. Staff goes above and beyond to help their clients to resolve any issues.  I can't brag enough about PT Solutions. BEST in town!!!
Very nice people. Great experience overall. Willing to progress or regress on movements. Really know what they are doing! 100% recommend!
"The staff are wonderful.  Great personalities and they know their stuff.  I stopped going because the therapists are all working with multiple patients at once.  I‚Äôm sure this is due to the fact that they are part of Wellstar, a large corporation with an eye on profit.  I just found it difficult to have a personal conversation with the PT"
PT Solutions is awesome.  I have had lots of problems with my back and they have really helped me in a short period of time.  Although the issues are not resolved I can tell a difference already.  The staff is very friendly and caring and takes lots of time to work with you at the appointments.  I would recommend to anyone that needs physical therapy.
Staff was incredibly accommodating! Very clean and contemporary clinic. The therapist has been nothing short of incredible with all of my needs! Won‚Äôt be going anywhere else!! Highly Recommend.
"Very helpful staff and a great physical therapist.  Make sure you request Brent, he was broke down the anatomy of my sports injury to help me understand the process of my recovery.  Something I didn't receive in my previous experience with PT.  The facility is very nice with the latest equipment, and the online portal makes it easy to track and progress in your rehabilitation plan.  Highly recommend."
I highly recommend PT Solutions for any physical therapy you need. Brent is knowledgeable about the body & different types of exercise to help with any problem area you may have. Amber is super sweet & gets you schedule quickly.
"I‚Äôve had a really great experience at PT Solutions in Cumming. The staff and Physical therapist are professional, knowledgeable , and fun to be around.
I‚Äôm getting stronger everyday and feeling better.  Much Gratitude! üíö"
When I first went in to see Brenton after 2 surgeries on my right arm I couldn't straighten it at all.  I can almost straighten it out and can actually lift things and open jars again.  Kelsey and Brenton are both very nice and knowledgeable.  Highly recommend PT Solutions on Marketplace Blvd
Brenton is fantastic and friendly staff!
The PT solutions team here is amazing! I‚Äôve never had such detailed treatment with such friendly people at PT ever before. Try this place! You won‚Äôt regret it.
The staff is great. Very knowledgeable about my issues and very understanding about how you are feeling. They take the time to get to know you and work hard to get you back to where you were physically.
"I am thrilled that we found Brenton at PT Solutions on Marketplace Blvd to help rehabilitate my daughter‚Äôs injuries. She‚Äôs a competitive cheerleader and he understands just how important it is for her to stay on the Team. He has taken the time to evaluate and customize a plan to put her back in tip top shape. If you are looking for someone with multiple physical therapy options who really listens to his patients, give them a call."
Highly recommended!! Brenton and staff are excellent! Physical therapy is never fun but if you want results go here.
Love this place. Brenton has successfully treated me and my husband.  You get very personalized treatment here unlike many of the PT mills run by doctor's offices.
"Everyone is friendly, caring, knowledgeable and are there to help. I highly recommend them!"
"The staff is amazing. They are friendly,  knowledgable and care about your recovery.  I would highly recommend them."
"I have been following the clinical director, Brenton Staley, from Lenox Rd. to Executive Park and now, to Cumming, because he is that good ! He listens and he addresses my problems aggressively but does not leave me without options to help myself. To make the experience at PT Solutions in Cumming even more impressive, he has two great assistants in Kelsey and Ronni. What are you waiting for ? Give them a visit !"
"My therapist is attentive, and dedicated to my cure."
"Great place, amazing staff, excellent service!! Definitely recommend coming here for you physical therapy needs!"
"Brenton was great!! Very informative, professional, and knowledgeable! Great experience!!"
"For a 1 hour PT appointment, I was billed over $1,000. That's absurdly high."






"I've been seeing Pushpa during my pregnancy and now for my postpartum care, and let me tell you, she is amazing and kind and she really knows how to deal with the pain I've been having with very effective methods. She listens to my concerns and answers all my questions as well. She really seems to know what she's doing and she is just really good at what she does! I would call her an expert in pregnancy and postpartum care!"
"Five months ago I walked into the hospital emergency room with what I thought was a minor issue with my right hand, only to learn that I had a serious infection in my brain.  The infection affected not only my hand, but also my left leg and my peripheral vision.. After ten day in the hospital, 17 days in an acute care rehab facility, and 12 weeks of twice daily antibiotic infusions the infection was gone and my vision issue  had resolved itself. Unfortunately I could barley walk or use my right hand.  I knew I needed physical and occupational therapy to fully recover.  I looked to Emory Select Physical Therapy - Duluth for these services.

I found the Emory Select Duluth facility to be staffed by well trained professionals who were always supportive and encouraging while at the same time challenging me to do more than I believed I was capable of. With their help, last week I completed both my physical and occupation therapy after meeting all of my established goals and I am now able to  pursue the lifestyle I enjoyed before my ""illness""

I would like to recognize and recommend the entire staff at Emory Select Duluth with a special ""thank you"" to Ramya, Pushpa, Gracy, Kim and Raghu.  What a great team.  Thanks to you all, I am well and most grateful."
"(Translated by Google) I had pelvic pain for 2 years and I went to many doctors and did not heal until my gynecologist recommended my PUSHPA therapist she is the best very professional and dedicated to her work she loves doing her job now I am healthy thanks to God and her

(Original)
Tenia dolor pelvico desde hace 2 a√±os y fui a muchos doctores y no logre sanar hasta que mi ginecologo me recomendo a mi terapista PUSHPA ella es la mejor muy profesionaly dedicada a su trabajo ella ama hacer su trabajo  ahora Estoy  sana gracias a Dios y a ella"
"Excellent option for Physical Therapy. Staff is absolutely fantastic, and takes the time to get to know their patients. Definitely see results in how I am feeling."
Good experience at Wellstar PT off Sandy Planes and East Piedmont. I highly recommend for anyone who needs PT. Staff is friendly and kind and aware of your needs.
Very professional & personable staff. Back pain instantly improved & was gone in a couple of weeks. Highly recommended.
"professional and friendly ,highly recommended"
"Still in therapy, very professional, very competent."
Love working with these guys! Got to work with both Kyle & Tony and they helped me restore my flexibility and strength after shoulder surgery. Loved the dry needling with Kyle!
I would highly recommend this place and having Kyle as a therapist. I had rotator cuff repair in January and already feel near back to normal again in June (was expecting a longer recovery).  I attribute this to a good surgeon and great physical therapy regiment that was custom tailored for my circumstances.
"Caring, helpful staff. Dr. Kyle willingly acknowledges my pain, how best to treat it and encourages me to share any distress I have between my appointments. During my treatment, they are showing me some simple, gentle exercises to help my back muscles gradually stretch and become stronger: thus helping my balance. I'm very comfortable when there and know that when I leave, I'll feel incredibly better!"
The staff at PT Solutions are helping my granddaughter improve her mobility! She comes home from therapy with less pain and is able to move better!!! They are a great team!!
"Very personalized.  Get a great workout each time I go.  Certainly no need to go to the gym on those days!  As a bonus, my foot is getting better!"
I was received well and those that i interacted with were Awesome. Good atmosphere .
Great location and access.  The entire staff cares and are knowledgeable about the service they are providing.  Lots of communication and input.  This is the place to go for your physical therapy!
Great and knowledgeable staff.
"PT Solutions - Sprayberry Square Shopping Center
I would like to express my deep appreciation to all PT Solutions staff, which made all my leg pain disappear.
Clinic director Kyle Payne, therapist Betsy Kreymer and many others paid a lot of attention to my needs.
Their high level of professionalism and experience brought my health to much better level. Thank you."
"This place is awesome! Highly recommend it to anyone needing physical therapy.  The staff is very courteous, kind, professional and knowledgeable!  I am getting so much out of each session because of their vast experience!"
"After an injury to my knee I visited my nurse practitioner and she and I both agreed I should have some physical therapy. I have been extremely pleased with PT Solutions. I noticed Improvement after my first visit, and each successive visit. The therapists and staff have been very attentive.  My appointments, as well as the exercises I  was prescribed to perform at home, have been perfectly geared to help me on the path to recovery. I look forward to my appointments and feel confident I am in good hands!"
"I have had physical therapy elsewhere with no results. PT Solutions is different!  I highly recommend trying Kyle Payne. I thought that I would have pain with every step for the rest of my life, but after the first week I had improved. After three weeks I have more pain-free steps than painful ones. I am so surprised and happy it is working!!"
"Great front desk staff who are very knowledgeable about insurance information and coverage.  The physical therapist here are great.  With the help of Ashley and Candace, I was able to get better and was able to return to my regular activities in no time."
Love the convenience in East Cobb. Great staff to be motivated by and scheduling is incredibly easy to work with. Wonderful group.  Highly recommend.
"Great experience, from the efficiently run reception area, to the profession therapy staff that work so well together for the benefit of their patients, to the clean and pleasant facility. I began services here for the convenience of location only but would continue to use this clinic for their wonderful service."
I came here for assistance with work related hip and lower back issues. The staff is amazing and very knowledgeable. They treat all of their clients like family!
Great service. Knowledgeable therapists. Friendly staff. They get results.
The physical therapists and staff are very knowledgeable in their particular field and take a very professional approach in their dealings with you.
These young employees are efficient and professional!  Kyle is my therapist and is making progress I can feel after only 6 sessions!
Great - easy to schedule an appt. and the therapists have been great!
"They're as Interested in my physical therapy as I am. They're committed, intelligent, & helpful."
They have been wonderful trying to help my daughter come back from a knee injury on our volleyball team.  Great service from the staff!
"I've only been to a couple of sessions so far, but my back pain seems to be lesseningüëçüèΩ."
Just starting treatments. Professional all the way.
Great service.









Really recommend this place. Christa was the sweetest! Always supported me in getting better and celebrating the small achievements. Truly feel like myself again.
"They are amazing! They truly want you to get better. Matt is amazing at what he does, knowledgeable in his care, and takes time to truly get to know his patients. They all have great attitudes and make coming to PT an enjoyable time. I truly think doing PT anywhere else would‚Äôve had a negative impact on my healing process. They go above and beyond for each and every patient. If you show up and put in the work here they will make sure your healing process is smooth and complete before you leave them. I was almost sad to be discharged from PT here."
"Matt and the Benchmark team are awesome! They are professional, highly knowledgeable and designed the best exercise program for me. I came there with a painful shoulder injury and and today I graduated with more mobility and strength. I am so pleased with my progress. I highly recommend Benchmark for any of your physical therapy needs."
"Matt Dupell is the best physical therapust I have ever had. He listens to what is going on in your body that day and gives different exercises to address that issue. He is also the best at hands on manipulation. On top of that, he is very personable and makes PT enjoyable, even if it sometimes hurts."
"Everyone there is very pleasant. I worked with Matt and he is very knowledgeable, helpful, and caring. He always make sure you are ok and your best interest at heart. He is very empathetic and understanding. My overall experience there was great. I would recommend anyone to give them a try."
"The team and staff at Benchmark physical therapy at 400 Tower Road are fantastic , they are consummate professionals using humor to lighten things up because they get it , they understand your pain and Work tirelessly to help you improve your health. I work directly with Sara and Matt who are excellent therapist and great human beings"
I used BenchMark for cognitive therapy after an injury from a car accident.   Christina Carroll was my therapist and she was absolutely amazing.   She was a ray of sunshine every time I walked in the door and she made the therapy so much fun.
"My experience at Benchmark physical therapy has been wonderful, I would recommend family and friends there for therapy.  MATT was my therapist whom I believe is the best!! All the staff was pleasant and professional."
"In August, I underwent knee replacement surgery and was referred to Benchmark for physical therapy. My therapist, Matt Ayers, has played an instrumental role in my recovery. His professional attitude and concern to ensure I made a full recovery was always a top priority. Every time i went to visit Matt, I could always count on a thorough and intense session. He was always punctual and made sure I had an enjoyable experience. I also had a wonderful experience with Regina, who was accommodating when it came to scheduling my sessions. This facility is committed to the safety of all their patients, including temperature checks, requiring masks to be worn and ensuring the facility remains clean at all times. I strongly recommend Benchmark for your physical therapy needs!"
"Very professional, knowledgeable, positive and encouraging Therapists and staff."
I had a great experience at Benchmark off tower rd in Marietta. The staff was very knowledgeable and the treatment helped me tremendously. I highly recommend them.
"The team at Kennestone is the best! Matt, Matt, and Christa truly care and make Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy fun."
"Benchmark therapy has helped me and my family so much! I absolutely love Gina, Chris, and Sarah! They are the sweetest! You can‚Äôt go wrong with this location :) I love you guys!"
"Make sure that you have all receipts and visits recorded. I was happy with the people there but come to find out there was a ""visit"" that I found out I stilled owed for. I always paid my co pay when I was there and had all receipts of these transactions. I also kept a schedule of when I was there and the schedule they printed for me. Come to find out, 5 months later I get calls from their corporate office saying I owe for a visit back in January. While telling them I wanted to review and get complete documentation on from the center I visited, I was sent to collections the same day. They were quick on the draw to get that money without letting me prove that I was not there. I just paid since they were adamant about the $60 they wanted. So beware of the billing."
"Great staff all around! Mathew, the man in charge is great and makes coming to therapy a breeze. My ankle will thank him and Benchmark for years to come!"
Really appreciate BenchMark. Everyone is awesome! Especially Sara! Bless you guys!
I absolutely love Philip! He is does an absolutely great job!! If you go here I recommend Philip!!

"I was fortunate to have choose directed to go to Benchmark for my physical therapy after shoulder surgery. Stephen is one incredible therapist. Not only was he patient with me but he is also a therapist who treats the whole patient, He has made me regain the mobility of my joint that after the operation was spoilt. I cannot say enough about how caring and professional Stephen is and the staffing. I am impressed with the entire personnel at Benchmark.   I'm glad that I invested the time to do PT as I healed. Thank you for your care.."
I primarily worked with Martina Cifiello. She was extremely knowledgeable about proper exercises and stretching techniques that greatly relieved the back and hip pain I was experiencing. All the other employees were extremely helpful and friendly too. I would highly recommend Benchmark in east cobb to anyone needing physical therapy.
"Martina was wonderful. I started my physical therapy very skeptical and ended with a better understanding of my physical health and much stronger than expected. If you need pelvis floor or lower back therapy, check her out! Thanks Benchmark!"
I had a wonderful physical therapy experience at BenchMark.  Steven and supporting staff exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend them.
"BenchMark helped me recover from an intensive hip surgery in 2016, so it was a no brainer to choose them again for a recent knee surgery. Steven tailored my therapy to my goals, and I graduated today having achieved all my goals. Everyone who works at BenchMark is incredibly welcoming and makes you feel like a celebrity every time you walk into and leave an appointment-such a positive and supportive environment!"
"I was referred to Benchmark by my midwife after being diagnosed with diastasis recti postpartum. For several weeks, I worked with Martina who specializes in pelvic floor therapy. She did an excellent job with the different exercises she had me performing to reduce the signs and symptoms of my condition. If I have another child, I will be sure to come back to her to be evaluated and treated again. I highly recommend Martina for women postpartum who may be experiencing any issues with their pelvic floor."
I love it there very friendly my therapist is the Bomb!!! Danielle ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"I just completed 6 weeks PT for a left TKR. Steven Griffin was my PT and was beyond amazing! Steven asked questions, listened attentively, and then developed an individual PT plan for my needs to get me fully mobilized. He is professional, knowledgable, caring and went the extra mile in helping me get where I needed to be! Steven is the best PT I have ever had over my many years! He is a blessing! This location has a very kind, caring staff and assistants too! If you need a PT, I highly recommend Steven Griffin!"
So very professional and helpful. Impressed that they could listen and understand even better than my words could describe.
"I worked with Stephen G there this summer after knee surgery. I was unhappy with the treatment at my surgeon's PT group. Stephen G developed a plan that met my personal goals, and fitness level. I honestly don't think I would have recovered as well as I have if I hadn't switched to Benchmark."
"Just completed 2 months of PT at Benchmark after a horrific injury that initially made it seem that
I would never run again. Steven Hightshue and the rest of the team did an extraordinary job getting me running 3 months ahead of schedule.  Steven met me where I was after getting out of the boot and made sure that I stretched the boundaries of what my body could do everyday until I was 98% recovered 3 months early.   The last 2% is on me to regain.  Cannot recommend Benchmark any more highly."
"Absolutely amazing and fulfilling experience.  This was my first time ever doing physical therapy. I worked with Steven Griffin who was beyond amazing - firstly he patiently understood the problem I was seeking relief for and structured a treatment regiment that worked wonders in just eight sessions. He was probably more committed to getting me to back to my  active lifestyle even more than I was!  Given my issue was not structural, he even got me to the point on not having to rely on any external aids.  Highly highly recommend."
"I just completed 2 months of PT with Steven Griffin for a knee injury.  He was professional, knowledgeable, and a pleasure to work with.  I'm glad that I invested the time to do PT as I healed."
"The staff was excellent in treating me following a hand surgery. Donna couldn‚Äôt have been more accommodating and helpful to get me set up and going with PT.  Steven Griffin was the best! He was thorough, knowledgeable and so wonderful to work with through my therapy."
I just completed Physical Therapy at the East Cobb location in Marietta GA with Martina to rehab after surgery for a Torn Rotator Cuff. Martina did an amazing job restoring mobility to my shoulder (Prior to therapy I never thought I would be able to raise my right arm again). The service and staff at this location were excellent and always accommodating. I would definitely recommend Benchmark to anyone in need of Physical Therapy.
"My condition was to recover from foot surgery. I had a cast, then a boot. I was not able to put any weight on my foot for 6 weeks. After that, therapy started while still using my boot.

Unfortunately, before I even started physical therapy, I did not have a positive attitude due to prior experience elsewhere which didn't go so well. However, here I am after therapy with Steven Hightshue, wearing regular shoes feeling no pain.

Steven was extremely professional, very encouraging, and observant.

The atmosphere is upbeat and the representatives at the front desk are helpful.

I would give Steven an A+ for his work and also would encourage anyone who needs physical therapy to contact BenchMark Physical Therapy."
"I suffered a severe back strain and was in really bad pain.  My orthopedic doc referred me to BenchMark.  The East Cobb location is near me, so I made an appointment to see Steven.  He worked magic on my lower back and my range of motion drastically improved after the first visit.  Throughout my subsequent visits Steven guided me through exercises that helped relieve my pain and strengthened my lower back. These exercises are now a part of my daily regimen.  I appreciate the fact that Steven worked with me to give me the tools I need to make horrible back pain a thing of my past.  The entire staff at BenchMark East Cobb is friendly, and I really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.  If I ever have the need for any kind of PT again, I will definitely go back to BenchMark."
"I had never had physical therapy so I didn't have a frame of reference for what to expect.  However, my husband had incredible results here post shoulder and knee surgeries, so I shouldn't have been surprised.
I didn't address my issue until it had worsened to the point where I was having trouble working on my laptop, driving, and even dropping things.  Feeling quite limited and unproductive because my left arm and hand would go numb was extremely frustrating.  My nerve injury, cervical radiculopathy, was not going to heal on its own.
My GP suggested physical therapy, and I'm amazed at the results.  I was treated by Steven Griffin who was able to relieve the pressure and provide valuable insight in my recovery without x-rays or medication.
After the initial assessment, I left my first session feeling more confident with my prescribed range of exercises.  This customized at-home program would be tailored to my progress.  During each session, he took time to listen to my concerns, answered any questions, and provided very helpful information and advice.  I believe his extensive knowledge, level of skill, and attention to detail - correcting my form, expedited my recovery.  Week by week my improvement was considerably significant.  I also appreciate the guidance from Billy & care from the other Steven too.  Everyone there is attentive to all the patients.  The environment is refreshing and quite engaging, yet they're thoughtful, professional, and completely focused.
These results far exceeded my expectations.  Without hesitation, I highly recommend Steven Griffin."
"Following major foot reconstructive surgery and a lengthy casting period, my surgeon recommended Benchmark for physical rehab. Steve Griffin, DPT was my therapist and from the initial consult, design of the PT plan, and very frequent sessions - everything about the experience was stellar. Steve's expertise and outstanding client-centered approach resulted in significant positive outcomes.  He seamlessly revised treatment in line with my progress and feedback - setting realistic goals that achieved optimal results. I can now continue my recovery at home thanks to the insightful and effective plan Steve designed. First rate experience and the entire Benchmark staff at their East Cobb facility were a genuine pleasure."
"I choose this location after rotator cuff surgery due to its proximity to home and orthopedic surgeon. I found the staff to be extremely pleasant, well-staffed given the high volume of patients, and extremely easy to work with. Scheduling was not a problem. The physical therapists and their technicians are well educated and very experienced. Steven G. was fantastic to work with and was willing to move as fast, or slow, as we felt I could. This was my second rotator surgery, my third time in physical therapy and BenchMark hits the mark..."
"After having an unsuccessful experience with a previous therapist, I switched to Benchmark PT and was able to see what real therapy is all about. My occupational therapist, Gina, was extremely knowledgeable and truly cared about getting me back to normal. Not only did she and her team get me back on the right track, I also enjoyed my time there as well. I am so grateful for their efforts and would strongly recommend their occupational services to anyone."
"Over the dog I fell,
And tore my PCL.

Since my knee could not be bent,
To physical therapy I was sent.

Benchmark they said to go,
Everything about rehab they know!

My therapist, the great Steve Hightshue,
Superior were he and his crew!

His knowledge was so very vast,
My rehab from him unsurpassed!

Nearly healed is now my knee,
Come in and you shall see.

You too will thank Dr. Steve,
His care you wouldn't believe!

Benchmark, they are the best,
Trust me, forget all the rest!"
"I just completed 10 sessions over 6 weeks of physical therapy at Benchmark with Steven Griffin after a total knee replacement. Steven is an incredibly knowledgeable and professional therapist. Each time I came for a session, he really listened to how I was feeling and what I thought I needed to advance my healing. He customized each session with cupping, dry needling, hands-on work, and strength building. Each time I left, I felt like I had made significant progress. I can't imagine having a better experience in recovering from this kind of surgery without him. I was back to work in three weeks and continue to get stronger every day."
"I can't say enough about the care I received at Benchmark Physical Therapy.  From the front desk staff to the therapists, everyone is so kind and committed to your recovery.  I was a bit skeptical as to whether PT would help me with the hamstring injury I received running.  However, Steven Griffin was able to not only get me back in the running game, but get me back pain free!  He really pin pointed what was causing my pain (which doctors were unable to do), then tailored therapy and exercises to target and strengthen the hamstring area.  Steven truly cares about his patients and makes their goals his goals. He is extremely knowledgable and is able to translate that knowledge into ""lay man"" terms.  I am very grateful for all the help he has given me and am excited to return to running!"
"Gina is awesome!! My hand is getting better and better!! I love to play with all her toys,and the hot box is my favorite!! Great job!!"
"I've been seeing Steven Griffin for the better part of 2017. He's been incredible! When I first went to see him, I could barely make it up and down the stairs because of my knees. Afterwards, I was back to my regular workout schedule and running up the stairs! I went back a few months later for some maintenance work so I could push myself even further without re-injuring myself. The ENTIRE staff here has been so great and fun and it's bittersweet that my sessions have ended!"
I was a walk in today following a surgical procedure to have a plate removed from my wrist. My surgeon wanted me in a split to assist with rehab on my thumb. I don't live near here but went right from my appt. Beth Garner was awesome and worked diligently to create a device which will facilitate healing while allowing me to rehab the thumb. üëçto her and Bench Mark.
"I have had PT with both Steven Griffin and Kirsten Lisk and both are stellar therapists. The entire crew here is amazing. They are professional, encouraging, and fun! Makes difficult sessions enjoyable. Benchmark has been a great fit for my recovery!"
The help from this Benchmark location is top notch! They help each other and you superbly. We have spent the summer after a car accident  with pain management therapy and they really care about your progress! Love to them all!
My shoulder therapy was exceptional at Benchmark (East Cobb).  Martina was very attentive to getting the most benefit out of my every session.  Best treatment I've experienced in this area. A fully staffed and well managed facility.
"I have been dealing with lower back pain for around 5 years. I have tried lots of different treatments all of which did not work.  After 2 months with  Benchmark I no longer feel pain in my lower back. I FEEL GREAT!

The team at Benchmark is fantastic! Kristen Is a great physical therapist who fully understands her practice and really cares about her patients. (Just don't make fun of Tom Petty Radio).

If you have any doubts on whether or not your should treat your pain or if its worth it, GO FOR IT! Benchmark will make you feel good as new!"
"I just want everyone to know that Steven Griffin is a very gentle, caring and professional person. With his extensive knowledge and help I have gone from a pain level of 9 or 10 down to at least 6 or 7 ....a significant improvement in only 8 sessions!
My Orthopedic doctor called for only 8 sessions to assess overall pain improvement in  my lower back and legs prior to other procedures and possibly in conjunction with more PT.
Steven knows how to be forceful when necessary to make sure I understand why certain exercises are necessary both at Benchmark and at home even though I complain a lot! I am very stiff and not athletic at all!
Steven is always patient, on time and has a big smile every time I walk in the door. He watches when I come in to see how well I move when I think he isn't paying attention.
This is all to avoid complicated scoliosis back surgery to replace 4 or 5 discs in my lower back with a long recovery period.
I highly recommend of course not only Steven but also Benchmark as their staff has been extremely kind, supportive and encouraging.
Thank you so much Steven and Benchmark!"
"After having a major shoulder surgery I chose BenchMark for my PT. I had a previous relationship with Kirsten the Clinic Director and her leadership and care to detail of my rehab was super. The entire staff is very knowledgeable and friendly and willing to help as needed. Im able to do things now better than ever and that's thanks to Kirsten and the entire staff.  If you have the need for PT, this is the place to go....."
"The Big and Loud program, with Kirsten, for Parkinson‚Äôs patients, is life changing!!! On the 4th of July, my dad went into the hospital because his Parkinson‚Äôs had gotten so bad he couldn‚Äôt walk, eat or do anything else without help. He had some in home rehabilitation after the hospital and that helped a little bit. On the 12th of August we started the Big and Loud program. Fast forward to today, September 6th (under a month later) and he is a different person, the one he used to be. He‚Äôs not only walking but he‚Äôs driving again and doing all of the stuff we thought he would never be able to do again.
When he heard that it was 4 days a week for 4 weeks he wasn‚Äôt thrilled to say the least but WOW did it pay off and was completely worth all of the hard work. We can‚Äôt say enough about Kirsten, she is AMAZING!! She has the perfect personality for physical therapy. She pushes when she needs to and is constantly encouraging you to be your best!!
The environment at Benchmark is laidback and you get to know everybody. The ladies at the front desk are so incredibly helpful. They know everyone‚Äôs names, seriously everyone‚Äôs!!
One more time...... LIFE CHANGING!!!!! If you are hesitant about the Bug and Loud program, don‚Äôt be. Stop thinking about it and go, you won‚Äôt be disappointed, you‚Äôll be able to get back to your old life again!!"
I walked into the Marietta clinic with a very painful lower right pelvis. All I needed is 5 sessions with Martina Cielo and the painful right pelvis problem is at 95+% healed.
Great place.  Very attentive staff and extremely comfortable atmosphere.  I highly recommend for any needs.  Kristen and Lizzie were fantastic.
"Very friendly and an overall wonderful staff. In particular I am thankful to Bre‚Äôanna, my physical therapist, she has really worked with me through the right stretches and excercises, massages, dry needling and very attentive and friendly. I have leg sciatica and lower back issues and every time I go I feel better."
Everyone there was so committed to making sure I received everything I needed to be up and running again after a back injury. Thank you Kirsten for you concern and care. I never thought I would feel this good ever again.
"Went in after several trips to my chiropractor and still in major pain, enough to keep me from sleeping. Bre'anna told me about dry needling and how my muscles weren't releasing and i am glad she did. After a few treatments I am back to normal. Highly recommend her and dry needling."
This place is absolutely fantastic!  The staff are so friendly and knowledgeable and made me feel very compfortabke and safe on my road to recovery. I suffered a severe back injury in July and under the care of Steven Griffin and Billy Ryan I have significantly recovered to being back to how I was before the accident.  Stephen and Billy are both so personable and nice and made it seem as if I were coming to hang out with friends while I was doing the excercises.  Janika Chaney is at the front desk and also so nice and always made sure to set my appointments in the time slots I needed after work.  I highly recommend this location and Stephen and Billy if your in need of physical therapy!
"Martina, Kareem and Yele were professional, encouraging, and knowledgeable about prescribing the most beneficial exercises to strengthen my legs and diminish the hip pain due to my MS.  The exercises were appropriate and realistic for me to follow through with at home.  Thank you for making a difference in the quality of my life."
"I worked with a physical therapist by the name of Steve Griffin. He helped me heal from a  neck and trapezius soreness that was affecting my daily life.   WhenI first came to Benchmark and East Cobb, I was in so much pain and was questioning that I might have to have surgery. By following my doctors orders and the exercises that Steven gave me, my pain went from Almost a 10 to a one or two. I figured out through Strengthening exercises and flexibility exercises how to deal with my discomfort.   Stephen did a great job of listening to me  about my aches and pains and triggers that were happening to create a great exercise plan.     I believe in physical therapy wholeheartedly, anything to avoid surgery. Once again, Stephen did an excellent job at treating my injury and helping me figure out a way to cope with my discomfort and make myself strong again.  In addition, the office was very good about communication and scheduling appointments and keeping things on time. I felt very well taken care of and I would recommend that everyone go to this location."
"Benchmark, particularly Steven is top notch. My rehab is ahead of schedule. They are very professional and know their stuff. I highly recommend."
"After shoulder surgery I required extensive physical therapy.
Benchmark in East Cobb is truly fantastic.
Everyone I encountered there including the admin staff, Biily Ryan and Khadijah Daniel, the Physical Therapy Technicians and Steven Griffin and Bre'anna Shopke, the Physical Therapists,  were truly great.  Everyone is highly professional, efficient and friendly.
After a short time, I felt like I was visiting with friends to do a guided workout.
Under their skilled care, I exceeded the surgeon's progress expectations along the way and have completed my physical therapy program.  I am now pain free and have achieved a great range of motion in my shoulder.

Steven and Bre'anna are highly educated, personable, and effective Physical Therapists.  All my questions and concerns were answered patiently, completely and in as much detail as desired. They are great people and I would not hesitate at all to go back to them if the need should arise again in the future.  Great Place, Great Experience."
"Great staff! They are friendly, professional, and focused on helping you achieve your physical goals."
Claressa Breckke did a great job helping me recover from surgery. Highly recommend them.
"My physical therapist, Yele Omidina, was fantastic.  Without him, I would still be in considerable neck pain.   He is caring, understanding, and knows what he is doing at all times. If I am ever in need of a physical therapist again, I wouldn't hesitate again to call Benchmark or Yele."
"My therapist, Yele Omindina, is one of the best therapists I have ever had.  He is caring, compassionate, knowledgeable and really listens to everything I am saying.  I had two unfortunate events happen to me this past year requiring two different surgeries.  He was up front and honest about what the path to recovery was for me in both circumstances, whether it was something I wanted to hear or not.  I was very scared post surgery due to soreness and lack of movement and he was always very gentle.  He has a very soft spoken voice, which calmed me when I was anxious.  I have been with Yele for over 9 months now, longer than most Hollywood relationships, and I can tell you it hasn't seemed that long because he makes me laugh every time I come in.  Sometimes I would say, ""I don't think I can do that exercise,"" and he would very confidently say, ""Yes, you can!""  I cannot put into words how much Yele has done for me and I owe him a great deal of credit for getting my broken body back in shape.  I truly admire the patience and hard work he puts into each and every client, especially me:)"
"Big changes in my life ,highly recommended"


Marissa is engaging and listens. I highly recommend as she continuously recommends new exercises and stretching to improve my lower back.  I highly recommend.
"Marisa Johnson was my physical therapist. I was more than satisfied with the level of care and her expertise on my injury. Not only was she empathetic, but Marisa provided ways to modify my exercise routine to gradually improve mobility and movement on my neck and arm . . . followed by a massage on my back (where I needed it the most) Her greatest trait was this: Her ability to listen. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants detailed and thorough care. Marissa is a perfect example of a data/organized physical therapist. She truly cares!"
"Emory Rehab Center is great! The facility is clean and the equipment is in tip top condition. My physical therapist, Michael Jones, is knowledgeable, attentive, and encouraging. I look forward to my sessions with him at the center."
Wonderful help staff.  Attentive and keeps the environment safe and clean.
"Leslie is my therapist and she is very experienced and awesome at what she does. Front desk staff is also so friendly and helpful. Liked the facility, it‚Äôs clean and easy parking."
Honestly they will give you some great feedback and recommendations and awesome staff. Please see Megan she is awesome
Very welcoming always catering to the patients and makes me feel safe during the pandemic.
Have been so happy in the patient-centered approach by my therapy team.  They have given me hope where others have not.  Have made so much progress on second visit.
"Professionals that do a great job. They will push you hard, but that's their job."
Marisa and team are great. They are focused to make the most of your time. They are consistently positive. Thanks
"I had great experience with this facility and the therapists.  They were very considerate, compassionate and caring.  I would highly recommend this facility to my family and friends."
I have been to 4 other Physical Therapy clinics in Atlanta. This one is the best by far. They are very professional and caring. Michael is an amazing therapist. The clinic is in a great location with great parking. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone needing Physical Therapy.
"Friendly & efficient personnel,  conveniently-located & well-sanitized office space and very helpful long-term plan for their clients. They have a great website with exercise videos that motivate you to keep going on your own. Bravo, Michael Jones & Co!"
The people that I worked with and that worked with me made available a new kind of future for what's possible.
Marisa really listens to what the issue is and then seeks a solution.
"I highly recommend Emory Rehabilitation in Tucker. The staff was always courteous, the office environment is COVID-safe, and the therapists I worked with were not only knowledgeable but encouraging. I never had trouble finding an appointment time that could work my schedule, which is another big plus."
Marisa is such a pro at PT. She listened carefully to my issue with a shoulder and crafted the exercises to loosen and strengthen the joint considerably. I would highly recommend her and the staff at Emory a Rehabilitation.
"The Center was clean and convenient. My therapist, Marisa, was knowable and helpful. She suggested exercises to relieve my problems."
Marisa is an excellent therapist. She wants to make sure you're comfortable with whatever she is presenting to you to try. She makes sure that you're ok. The whole staff is very welcoming and kind. I like how they're always willing to help each other's client when they can't get to them right away. Excellent staff.
Very nice people. Very encouraging. Marissa is amazing and truly listens.
"All of the Physical Therapists at this Emory Rehab facility are great.  My main therapist is Michael Jones, who is excellent.  He takes the time to evaluate my condition properly upon each visit, addressing my concerns and pain level and then providing the appropriate therapy.  But when I haven't seen Michael each therapist I have seen has taken the time to refer to all of the previous case notes and provide guidance and the proper exercises to build on what has been done in the past.  Additionally, I have NEVER had to wait for my appointment as they seem to always run on time.  I am improving and owe it all to the great therapy and concern shown by this therapy group.  I highly recommend them."
"This rehab center is nestled away in a Tucker shopping center.  Flexible appointment hours are offered,  along with ample parking.  While smaller than most, this center provides a more intimate opportunity to rehab after surgery or injury.  I found the staff to be professional, personable, and eager to assist patients during recovery.  I recommend this rehab center, without reservation, to anyone facing the challenges of rehab."
"The staff at Emory Rehab is great!  They are friendly, but professional.  They make sure you get the proper exercises to recover from your injury or operation & that you do them CORRECTLY.   Although a small facility, they have all the necessary equipment and everything is kept very clean & tidy."
Awesome service awesome facility
"Marisa and the whole staff were fantastic. There expertises, patients, persistence and drive have helped me get most of my mobility back. I know I will have to take this on my own at some point. I wish you had a Rehad Gym here or near by so patients can continue there rehab on there own.
THANK YOU
Ed"
"I've rehabbed here twice, my daughter once. Every time has been an excellent experience with this professional and caring staff. I can't recommend them highly enough."
"Michael is awesome and the whole team is very friendly and professional. If you need physical therapy, this is the place to come!"
"Mike related to my surgery with good advice, clear instructions with respect to all individuals in the clinic. His workout made a difference in my recovery."
"I was treated by Kyle. It was an enjoyable experience because he is an excellent professional and a nice person, too."
"Very supportive, caring and patient with instructions, progress & challenges!"
This is a great location for a rehab center.

My sister was a patient for several months. While she was there she was quarantined. We asked her doctors daily why she was quarantined and we were told they were waiting for the results of her culture. I am not a medical expert but I knew it didn't take months for a culture to come back. I found out the day she was discharge that she had MRSA. The ems technician asked and the nurse told him. The doctors and nurses lied to us daily.  I can't recommend this facility. I know that this behavior should be a violation of medical ethics.
"First time using Benchmark after a partial replacement of my right knee. I had the privilege of being treated by the Director, Lori Brown Pressler. The staff is very friendly, the atmosphere is very open, the instructions are very clear and the staff seemed very professional and well informed."
"BenchMark Physical Therapy Cleveland Ga is wonderful! I received great results from therapy & the staff are all friendly, encouragingly & informative. The staff work together so well & so supportive of each other. This makes for an awesome atmosphere. I highly recommend this facility."
My wife and I were always treated with courtesy and respect. BenchMark has a very friendly atmosphere that makes healing fun!
"Very friendly staff who genuinely care for their patients! I'm a current student PT working with Lori and Heather and I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience so far. The atmosphere is very welcoming from the amazing staff to the easy-going patients. Jessica and Pam upfront make scheduling a quick and easy process, our techs Micah and Junior work hard to get patients going, and PTs Lori and Heather expertly assist patients through the rehab process. Both of them are very experienced with a wide range of patients and have demonstrated a patient-first attitude to help patients get back to what they love doing! If we had any Benchmarks back home in southern California, I would definitely recommend any friends and family to one of their clinics!"
The PTs and technicians are very hands on with instructing and educating you on all the correct exercises and movements appropriate for your condition. I've had nothing but warm welcomes and above average service since I have been there. I would definitely recommend to any family or friends!
BenchMark in Cleveland has a wonderful and welcoming atmosphere. The therapist are so genuine and  truly care about their patients recovery. I would recommend this office to anyone needing physical therapy.
"Benchmark is an amazing place. The PTs and OTs are very knowledgeable, friendly, and genuinely care for all the patients. They all make you feel like it is one big family. I definitely recommend this clinic for everyone who is in need of PT or OT!"
I had rotater surgerey.Started of at the Cleveland Ga location.My Therapist Jessica Harrison has helped me so much.including exercises for home.Helper tech Zac.great to.Every one at location is top notch.I would recommend to everyone.I know I'm going to recover 100percent because of they're knowledge of rehabilitation. .GodBless them all.Including office staff.A great place


I found Centered Recovery to be a harbor in the storm. I gained an understanding about myself through our group settings which allowed me to calm anxiety and become centered. The staff at Centered Recovery are compassionate and highly knowledgeable and comprehensive focusing on the many facets of recovery.
"When I first started my journey with Centered, I wasn't sure if it was the program for me. I remember thinking on my first day, is this really what will work for me? Unsure but hopeful, I stuck with it. That was the best decision I've made for myself in a long time. Centered offers a different approach that doesn't just hone in on addiction, and setting what could be perceived as unrealistic goals while going through your journey. I have learned a lot more than expected. From struggles we all face in daily life, to better ways to handle stress, I couldn't recommend a better place. It truly feels like a family. If you will allow yourself to be open, you will not regret your decision. Best advice: Be a statue with ears, and take it all in. Good luck!"
"This is a one of a kind program.  It guides its students to make an entire switch in how life is perceived.  I came here because I had a great deal of anxiety, poor coping skills, and always felt I wasn't enough.  What I learned is there is nothing out there in the world or a relationship to make me feel that way - it was all in my own head.  Whatever happened to be in the past or my fear of the future doesn't matter.  It's all just my thoughts creating a sense of me through my own memories I had stored over the years.   It's really a profound approach to addictive behaviors.

Both Reed and Krista, the owners, are Hilarious.  And if nothing else you can get a good laugh from them during classes!   The rest of the staff and the facility are also both welcoming and provide a sense of comfort from the start.  I never felt belittled or judged like I did with other types of programs.  Highly recommend to anyone with or without addiction problems!"
"Centered Recovery is a profound and life-changing facility, as it provides all of the knowledge, tools, and support necessary to guide an individual through their own healing.

The program offers in-depth group discussions hosted by a variety of class facilitators (each with their own unique style) as well as additional benefits according to a client‚Äôs level of care. These sessions allow for clients to broaden their perspective and understanding of addiction, as well as life itself, using a mindfulness-based approach to recovery.

Centered, unlike most rehabilitation facilities, informs clients using current scientific research as well as personal experience from class facilitators that the ability to fully recover and even create a life of health, happiness and abundance previously unimagined, lies in the hands of the individual.

As a current class facilitator at CRP (and former addict of external validation along with emotional numbing), I can say with great joy that I am so grateful to have found such a welcoming home within the realm of recovery. I feel that I am working alongside individuals that have a genuine passion for helping others heal and even more, I feel beyond supported in my desire to help others through facilitating group discussions, as well.

I am continually inspired by the conversations that are had and the transformations that have taken place in my eight months of working with Centered thus far. This program is not just for those recovering from alcohol or substance use; it is for absolutely everyone ‚Äî especially those struggling to understand why life ‚Äúisn‚Äôt going the way they want it to.‚Äù I guarantee you are in for a treat, or more-so, a paradigm shift from the inside, out!

If you (or someone you know) feel as if you may never reach a place of peace within your mind and body, Centered Recovery will empower you to understand that you are always one thought away from creating your desired reality."
"The staff and concept of this place is not like anything else you'll find and that is a good thing.   As I approach completing the program, it is so much more than a recovery program.  It is an approach to life and thought that will positively affect all aspects of your life, from relationships to employment to recovery.  It is the type program you don't want to ever finish because of the people you have come to know and the conversations and school of thought you share once you have been in the program a while and let the concepts sink in. It is hard to explain to others or even properly review.  But if you have tried more traditional approaches that just weren't right for you consider something completely different.  I am so glad I did!"
"We are so very grateful and appreciative that we found Centered to help our son.  After years of struggle and trying to find the right direction to turn, we knew right away, that we had finally found the perfect place for him to get help. This is an issue that greatly affects the entire family, and for many years we felt hopeless and had no clear direction.  When our son initially contacted Reed , it became apparent  that there was a connection and a possibility of tangible positive results.  As we witnessed his journey through the program, and his interactions with all of the excellent conselors, we realized he had finally found the best match.  Centered Recovery takes a different approach to mental illness and addiction and we all would highly recommend it for anyone who is struggling and searching for help. This program has been life changing our son and our family and we feel confident that our son can move forward now and live the life that he deserves.  Our highest commendation to the entire Centered Recovery Team!"
"I really can‚Äôt say enough about my positive experience at Centered. It is a place I wish I had found long ago but am so great full that I found it when I did. It has changed the way I think about all aspects of my life from the personal to inter-personal. I truly appreciate the honesty of the Centered staff and leadership as they were able to work with my insurance and were totally upfront with all out-of-pocket costs. I never thought I would look forward to attending group classes/sessions but here, at Centered, I really do. I truly believe this is a program for all. Absolutely no judgment or shame to be felt here."
"Centered has truly changed my Life. After multiple attempts with different faith-based and 12-step program, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to find it within myself to fix my problem. After just 7 weeks with Centered, they have helped me find the strength, discipline, and confidence to be in control of my mind and body. The program isn‚Äôt for everyone, but for someone like me, it was exactly what I was looking for.

During the group sessions, I never feel as if I‚Äôm in ‚Äúrehab‚Äù with a bunch of ‚Äúaddicts,‚Äù but more so in an environment with other individuals who are looking to grow within themselves and be better every day. Can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next with the program!"
Incredible program and great staff! Reed Smith had found a way to literally provide top notch services to ‚Äúcenter‚Äù people‚Äôs recovery process. Kudos to Centered Recovery and all the hard work! üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
"I appreciate and admire the philosophy and approach that Centered Recovery has crafted. This is not your typical, cookie-cutter recovery program. Expect to be supported and challenged on your way to growth and your personal evolution."
"As I reflect upon my time at Centered Recovery Programs, I keep coming back to the same word‚Ä¶‚ÄùWow!‚Äù.  The Centered program not only significantly helped me with my addiction recovery, but it also made me a better person in general.  Their program is based upon addressing the root cause of individuals‚Äô addiction, anxiety, stress, worry, depression, and almost any other thought-based condition.  I can easily recommend Centered as a means for just about anyone to achieve awareness and happiness in their lives.  Centered is not just an addiction recovery program‚Ä¶it is a life altering/improving program.
I want to say a rousing THANK YOU to the founders and team members‚ÄîReed, Krista, Colin, Ash, and Susan‚Äîfor all the education, leadership, and support that you gave me in my quest for sobriety.  I hope to remain close to the Centered organization upon completing my formal program, and I look forward to the Saturday ‚Äúalumni‚Äù sessions!"
"If you are reading this review, it probably means you have decided you need help.  Asking for help is the most difficult but bravest thing you can do.  That is a big first step and you should be proud of that. Centered has been a completely positive experience for me.  I enjoyed my time here and just can‚Äôt say enough good things about the program and staff.  I have learned that I have always been ok, but I lost the ability to see that.  Centered showed me the way back to my innate wellbeing.  This is not a typical recovery program - it is a thinking recovery program.  Whatever your challenge, this program will allow you to focus on the underlying thinking problem that got you here.  What you learn at Centered will change all aspects of your life in such a fundamental way that you may just forget the current reason why you are reading this now.  I plan to stay involved with Centered and hope to meet you on your journey to a better life."
"Centered Recovery provides a supportive group environment for exploration of your thinking, memory, habits and the real opportunity for change. The experience is open , thoughtful and my personal journey has been transformative,  The therapists are experienced, authentic and offer a variety of mindful teachings for your recovery from the repeated patterns of addiction.  I highly recommend Centered Recovery"
"Centered truly saved my family. My husband, the father of my child, is with us today because of what the amazing folks at Centered taught him. Now, I will give credit where credit is due - he did a 40 day in-patient stay prior to Centered and it was certainly the catalyst to his recovery. He had to get away from the substance to then learn how to process the day to day and live a healthy and fulfilling life. Once clear headed, he connected with the Centered group leaders in a way I believe he never thought possible and discovered a new, positive way of thinking.  A new way to live.  He remembered how to appreciate the little things in life and what‚Äôs most important.  He had completely lost sight of this when he was consumed by a substance. He‚Äôs more focused, more appreciative, more honest and more sincere than he‚Äôs ever been. Centered helped set him free and for that, I‚Äôm forever grateful."
I‚Äôve worked in the treatment industry for over a decade and it is hard to find people who care as much as Reed and Krista do. Centered has incredible treatment and amazing staff who care about each individual they work with. I would highly recommend them to any person or family who maybe be struggling.
"Excellent program & excellent staff. Concept is simple and life changing on many levels. It helps put ""you"" back in control. No sponsors, re-living the past or being under the thumb of an invisible uncontrollable power. Discover an understanding of your thoughts and how they affect your mind and body. Learn to identify your thought created self and start living as your present self. It takes a little open mindedness and willingness to listen. The rest sort of takes care of itself.  It is pretty surprising."
"One year ago today, I spoke to Reed from Centered Recovery for the first time and my life changed forever. I was miserable and had only one speck of hope for recovery and redemption left. I am grateful every day that the speck was enough to completely turn things around for me. That turnaround is thanks to the help, dedication, time, and hours of support that I have received from Reed, Colin, Krista, and all those at Centered that show up day after day with their whole selves to help others find their path to recovery. That day I didn't know what I was looking for or what would help, but I reached out and thankfully I got exactly what I needed.

What I have learned at Centered Recovery works. By that I mean that I have been able to right my ship. I understand myself better than ever before. I am able to show up with my best self each day for myself, my family, work, my friends, and even strangers. My relationships are better. My job and financial situations are better. Everything in my life is better, but most importantly, I have a peace of mind today that I've never had before. That is due to what I have learned at Centered Recovery.

If you are struggling and feel like there just has to be a better alternative, then I strongly suggest that you connect with Centered Recovery, show up, and listen. You may not hear what you expect, but you might just hear exactly what you need. Centered Recovery is the real deal.

Thank you from the bottom to the top of my heart to everyone at Centered Recovery and best wishes to all of you looking for a better way to live. This worked for me and I wish that you find peace in your journey."
"I am so grateful to have found Centered! I have never been introduced to this approach to recovery until Centered and it has truly changed my life.  I have a new perspective on life that allows me to stay centered even when external circumstances are difficult. I would advise anyone and everyone to come to Centered! I was constantly searching for peace and happiness outside of myself, but Centered taught me that it has always been inside me. I have the utmost respect for the staff here, as they are spreading this incredible approach to life. They have guided me towards a level of freedom from my addiction and a deeper understanding of myself that I never thought was possible. Now I am able to view the world in a completely different way and I want to share what Centered has taught me with everyone!"
I do not know where to start. Centered recovery and the staff help you to have a shift in your perspective that allows you to see life in a totally different light. At centered the staff helps you along the way to realize you are not broken and in my experience that is the shift  I was looking for .
"It is hard for me to explain in words how this place saved my life.  I used to be addicted, not just to substances but to how I viewed the world.  I had attented two ""traditional"" 12 step rehabs before finally landing at Centered Recovery.  Centered Recovery helped cultivate insight within myself to move onward from my negative thinking, or more accurately put to be free from it.  And once that happened, I was changed forever.  I am now married, own a home have two dogs and a job that I love.  I would not be where I am now without Centered Recovery and my friend Reed.  If you are reading this review, if you feel lost, if you're not sure what your next move is, all you have to do is pick up the phone and give them a call.  You will be transformed."
"I abused alcohol for twenty years. Hard drinking was a part of my life every day, all day. It sabotaged my physical health and negatively affected my relationships, my career and my marriage. I was totally addicted, physically and mentally.

I connected with Reed from Centered a few days after completing a seven-day detox, thus beginning my first experience with addiction therapy. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew enough about 12 step programs to know I wanted an alternative. Centered is that alternative!

The foundation of Centered Recovery's program is focused on behavioral therapy. Addiction is not viewed as an illness or disease but a learned behavior that is strengthened by physical and neurological repetition. No steps, sponsors or mantras. Self-reflection, mental rewiring, and self compassion are offered here. The classes range from abstract philosophical thought to factual information, and you can choose whichever style best suits you.

Through working with Reed, Colin, Ash, Susan and Krista, I've made some incredible discoveries about my mind, brain and body. The lessons I've learned here expand beyond treating my addiction. My entire life has changed.

The result is a ""Me"" that experiences real freedom and genuine happiness, unburdened by the concept that I am in remission from an ailment that could strike back at any time. If you're ready for things to get better, Centered Recovery will help you see it through."
"I am so grateful for finding Centered Recovery. Reed and Colin have opened my eyes to a new way of life. They have helped me discover a side of me I never knew I could be, helped me communicate with others better, and have overall given me peace in life. I never thought I would be happy with myself again whether I was drinking or not drinking until after a few group sessions every bad thought I had about myself was progressively disappearing. I have learned to flip the switch from telling myself all the bad to all the good. My relationships with my friends, family, and significant other have dramatically gotten better. I can not thank the Centered staff enough for everything they have done for me. Thanks to them, I will forever live a healthy and mindful life!! Would 100/10 recommend!!!"
"Centered Recovery has literally changed my life.  After years of alcohol abuse with some rehab and counselling along with the way, I was still completely lost.  I was recommended Centered Recovery and right from the beginning I knew I had found the right place. It's completely different to anything I had ever been exposed to before.  Their approach to addiction is phenomenal.  I am into my 4th month with them and its become a part of my life.  I feel at peace!
Thank you to Reed and his amazing team for always being there for me."
"Centered has 100% changed my perspective on life in the best way. Their program is unlike anything I've ever tried, and has given me the tools I need to navigate life in a positive way without trying to escape it. I always felt out of place in 12 step programs, and Centered showed me that there are so many more uplifting ways to stay sober! I have never been clean for this long and I owe it all to Centered. Its an amazing place with amazing staff and peers for anyone thats trying to truly change their life. I recommend them to anyone in search of getting and staying sober!"
"Where do I even begin... I was hesitant coming into Centered Recovery at first because I have tried just about everything to stay clean and sober. I had just gotten out of a 90 day intensive, residential program and immediately relapsed about a week after getting home. I knew I needed a new approach and I‚Äôm so happy I found Centered Recovery. I did group outpatient sessions with Reed, and they have been a game changer. I now look at recovery as everyday living and not so much as a checklist that needs to get done... I don‚Äôt feel the obsession to drink anymore and feel like my life is managed by me; not by a 12 step program like I have in the past getting sober. I have been sober for 8 months now, and I cannot recommend Reed and Centered Recovery enough. It has changed my life, and I‚Äôm so grateful to be apart of this wonderful program!"
"Liberation and revolutionary change are possible with Centered.  Giving them a chance was the best decision I have ever made for my sobriety, mental health, and well-being. Centered Recovery Program provided the scientific knowledge, tools, and support network that inspired me to invest in a life free of self-affliction.

The culture and team at Centered are remarkable. No judgement, no guilt, no shame.  They are accepting, supportive, selfless, and accommodating.  CRP flexibly tailors treatment based on your needs.  They offer collaborative in-person or virtual educational lectures.  Topics range from neuro-linguistic programming to the philosophy of consciousness.  You will learn real-world skills for coping with addiction, neural remapping, and mindfulness practices with functional applications.

If you are seeking help, Centered is the answer.  I was skeptical.  I‚Äôd explored about every avenue there is for treatment.  Then I found Centered.  They shattered my expectations and helped me change my perception, habits, behavior, and mind."
"We searched and searched for a recovery program that was not based in AA because it just did not work for my son. I was really hopeful when we found Centered since it was rooted in mindfulness-based practices, but we didn't know for sure if it would be helpful. Just a few days in, our son told us it was transformative. I cannot adequately express how it has changed our son for the positive. This program is about so much more than addiction recovery. It is truly about learning how to live life differently. If you are looking that sort of transformation, this is the place for you."
"I can't stress enough how amazing this program is! I have been on a long journey with my recovery with some success here and there with the treatments and programs that I have tried, which have been many and done with much determination. Unfortunately nothing truly spoke to me and therefore never really stuck with full success. What Centered has given me is answers to questions I feel that I have been asking myself my whole life and a perspective that goes far beyond me being able to tackle the issues that my addiction creates. What Centered has given me is a better way to live my life.  What a gift. I am eternally grateful."
"Centered Recovery offers the unique experience that my husband needed to finally get clean and sober.¬†¬†Addiction is a family disease that our family has suffered with for well over a decade.¬†¬†We tried 12-step programs, which often worked for a short period of time, but each period of sobriety was followed by the hurt and chaos of another relapse.¬†¬†We had almost resigned ourselves to this pattern of sobriety and relapse, hoping only to extend the former and minimize the latter.

We eventually took a chance with this non-12-step recovery program because we had nothing to lose.¬†¬†Within weeks I could see that something was different.¬†¬†My husband wasn‚Äôt working to stop using, he simply stopped using.¬†¬†I‚Äôm not 100% sure of how Centered is different, only that its working and my husband is not only not using, he is starting to enjoy life on its own terms.

If you‚Äôve tried and failed 12-step recovery programs you have nothing to lose by giving Centered a shot.¬†¬†It was exactly what my husband needed and he tells me that many others are also finding a sober life through the program.¬†¬†I hope your family can find the comfort we have found."
"Centered's approach for recovery has been truly life changing for me. I feel like they have helped me re-gain the self-awareness I need and enabled me to have a new perspective that is helpful in all areas of my life. Through the program, I have found so much peace and feel like I am re-discovering who I am and my values. I feel like it has opened my mind and made me want to continue learning and experiencing more in life with a fresh perspective. Centered has given me the ability to find what works for me, and recognize that there is not one single path to living a better life."
Beautiful facility and great people.  I highly recommended Centered Recovery!
"In my search for peace through the years, substances were all I could ever find to quiet down the destructive thoughts in my head - thoughts of inadequacy, of not measuring up, thoughts of being alone, of always being behind, and on and on and on...not anymore.

The Centered Recovery program and the incredible team that work there helped me discover the relief I've always been looking for. There is no other program or tool or means of finding inner peace out there, that I'm aware of, like the one that Centered allowed me to find. Centered is not just another program helping to overcome addictions. It is a unique place that is the difference between a life spent chasing external means to fix internal problems and a life lived from a place of peace and fulfillment.  There are no tricks, no steps, no gimmicks and no working to the program...all that is necessary is a willingness to listen - that's it.  And, somehow, unexplainably, relief and peace comes.

If you're skeptical like I was and think ""I'm sure the program worked for some but it won't for me"", just give Centered Recovery and the team a try, you will not regret it."
Life changing experience. It‚Äôs everything they say it is
"Centered, has been a real blessing for our family.  My wife entered the program in May of 2018.  The staff at Centered helped her to stay focused on the now and helped her release some of the pain of the past.  Through a holistic approach Centered expanded the tools for coping with addiction with tools like meditation that are available right now and at any time it is needed.  She also deals with chronic pain and Centered has helped to lighten her pain through mindfulness exercises. I would highly recommend Centered to anyone that is seeking direction on making themself whole through time tested techniques. Thank you Centered!!"
"I came to Centered Recovery Program after struggling with alcohol and a plethora of other substances for over ten years. I had stopped using one substance or another just to replace it with another through the years and finally decided to seek help when I realized I was just spinning my wheels and ending up at the same place.
The curriculum of what is taught and how Centered approaches the problem is life changing. I have never been more sure of my ability to stay sober but also those around me have also noticed an incredible change in how I behave. The staff here all has immense knowledge in what is being taught and how anyone can apply it to help change their situation and be their own sponsor and live a fun and fulfilled life. Even if you feel like there Isn‚Äôt a substance problem but just know something in your life and the way you live needs to change, this is definitely the place to help you see it to fruition. Reed, Krista, Colin, and Mike all bring an immense amount to the program and have all helped my growth out of one of the worst places I have been to a place of peace, contentment, and excitement of what is to come next moving forward. I would highly recommend this program to anyone. I did a lot of research beforehand as well and rarely leave reviews but I hope this can help someone in their decision and in turn help them in life as centered has helped me."
"I have just started my journey at Centered Recovey about 4 weeks ago and words can‚Äôt express how fabulous this place is. The program is awesome and I‚Äôm learning a lot about myself. The staff are all professional and friendly and most of all the owners Reid and Kristin are also involved in the process. I would highly recommend this place. This place has saved my life. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Thank you

I'm a a huge fan of Centered Recovery. The staff there is warm and welcoming. The program at Centered has made a huge difference in my outlook on addiction. The classes and coaching have been a huge help for me overall.
"I‚Äôve spent almost twenty years in twelve-step recovery with two periods of long-term sobriety‚Äî5 years and then over 11 years. After a lengthy relapse, I hit a bottom and found some willingness to give up and get sober again. Given my extensive experience with traditional recovery programs, it was suggested that I try an outpatient program that took a different approach to sobriety. This is how I found Centered. I‚Äôm not glad that I relapsed, but if it took all of that to lead me to Centered and make me willing, it was worth it.
What I‚Äôve gotten from my time at Centered is honestly difficult to put into words. What I‚Äôve found is beyond sobriety. Centered has provided me with an awareness and a concept for life that has created space and a sense of ease that I never had in previous periods of sobriety. To put it in simple terms, the world just doesn‚Äôt weigh as much now.
There are no mottoes or mantras, no imperatives, and no dogma at Centered. All that was asked of me was to listen and consider the ideas put forth. While I was expecting to find skills or counseling to help me stay sober, what I‚Äôve found is a shift in perspective that has improved my life and the lives of those around me.
All of the counselors and staff at Centered are great, but Reed specifically has helped me in ways that can‚Äôt be overstated. Without any preaching or prodding, Reed simply suggests that maybe there‚Äôs another way to look at things. And with this simple suggestion, Reed‚Äôs help has led me to insights that make life easier, less complicated, and happier. Instead of feeling like I‚Äôm at odds with the world most days, there‚Äôs breathing room in my life, which allows me to be present and feel connected. Life‚Äôs not a battle these days and I owe that shift in perspective to Centered.
I‚Äôve never been one to promote recovery or suggest that one specific program could provide someone with the relief they may be seeking. Even more, I never thought I‚Äôd find myself compelled to leave a review for a recovery center. But Centered is that important. The peace, serenity, and ease that always seemed promised, but never quite achievable for me in traditional recovery, has been realized through my time at Centered. If you‚Äôre looking for a true change and are open to the possibility of what is, Centered can help."
"Not everyone is for Centered, but Centered is for everyone! The holistic approach to mindfulness in recovery helps anyone and everyone - no matter what stage you are in your recovery. I look at the world in a completely different way, all thanks to the staff here. I would 10/10 recommend!"
"I have been going to Centered now for a little over 4 months.  Everything about this place is awesome!  The staff are truly caring people and the ‚Äúcurriculum‚Äù is so different than other treatment centers.  I do not necessarily like the 12 step program for myself, so this is a perfect alternative.  You really learn how the human mind works and how your thoughts affect your decisions, life, everything.  I actually enjoy my time spent here, I don‚Äôt dread coming into the group meetings.  I‚Äôd highly recommend this place to ANYONE!"
"I reached out originally to Centered Recovery in hopes of reeling in my substance abuse and alcoholism. I saw the program and noticed they were non-AA based, which struck my interest. In ended up getting  the contact to a person named Colin. We texted and chatted about where I was in my second relapse and what kind of game plan I was thinking about in my journey to recovery again. I was then a day later contacted by Reed, the owner. He was very upfront and unwelcoming from the start. He slammed right into talking about money and insurance. No even a hello, how are you, can you tell me a little bit about your situation, nothing.

I told myself, hey maybe hes busy or in a bad mood, dont worry about it. I stayed optimistic and decided to go into inpatient rehab at another facility due to the HIGH deductible and Reeds unwillingness to offer any alternative payment solutions. I only stayed a couple of days at the inpatient rehab due to a horrible situation (facility shall remain unnamed for privacy). Practically crawling out of the worst depression and mood I have felt in years from the unnamed facility and the experience, I lifted my spirits up and decided to contact Centered Recovery once again for help. I talked to my psychiatrist, changed some medications around and started to feel better. Reed said to come in later that week and get the process started. I walked in the door, ready to start recovery and smiling from ear to ear in hopes of winning this battle against substance abuse. I met with a nurse who checked my vitals and asked me several questions. About 40 minutes in, she asked me to take a drug test. I took the test and she read it, looked back up to me and said ""Well this is the end of the road?"". -____- Ummmm ok? What do you mean the end of the road? I stood there baffled and confused, she explained to me that I still had cocaine in my system, I said yeah..... Im still detoxing off of it, Im not actively using it. She said ""well youll have to come back in two weeks, theres the exit have a great day. Wow. Ok real cool. I said to myself on the car ride home, that I was going to stay optimistic and come in 2 weeks and went about my drive home. I got home and texted Reed about what happened and asked him if there was any kind of virtual sessions or anything that I could at least start on during that two week period in fear that Im would relapse. He said "" No. Your not a client"". I said wow ok. He replied with a thumbs up. I have not heard from anyone reaching out from this place to see how I was doing and if I wanted to come back. Mind you I have been drug tested 3 TIMES since leaving and all came back clear.

Incomprehensible, rude, uncaring response from the owner of a recovery program. I held my tongue and ignored it. I decided that I was tired of recovery programs, tired of rehab and that the only person that was going to make me stay sober is myself. I am 27 days sober and feeling great.

Please reconsider coming to this place if you are seeking genuine and caring help to treat your addiction."
"I only gave this place 5 stars because 6 stars wasn‚Äôt an option. üòÇ Honestly though, this is truly a one-of-a-kind place. If you‚Äôre searching for an IOP that looks at the topic of addiction from a different angle, then THIS is the place for you. Mindfulness is definitely a ‚Äútrending‚Äù word these days, but the classes that Reed & the rest of the staff at Centered teach go far beyond the average persons idea of what mindfulness is. If
you‚Äôre disillusioned with the same ol classes you‚Äôd get at a standard IOP, give this place a try. If you are open to new concept & ideas, then this program & it‚Äôs concepts will not only help deal with the drug/alcohol issues, but help change the way you interact with everyone in your life, for the better."
"This place is amazing!! Highly recommend it! Today was my first real test in sobriety! I found an old weed pen with some oil in it. I had the thought of hitting it because nobody would really know. My heart started to pound as I contemplated the thought of getting high. Being aware of your thoughts is so powerful. After I threw the pen away, I went back to whatever I was doing. Would have never been able to do that with out learning about the mind üôè"
"Centered has given me so much... A general sense of calm, better communication with my loved ones, better communication with myself, and most importantly a better understanding of what‚Äôs going on in the ol‚Äô noggin.  If you‚Äôve tried other approaches and still don‚Äôt feel as if you‚Äôve conquered whatever mountain you‚Äôre on, please try Centered, and give it your all.  Without exaggeration, it will absolutely change your life.  A big thank you to all the compassionate, understanding facilitators.  P.S. Collin you‚Äôre my fav"
Centered was integral in my recovery because it was a unique approach outside of a 12-step program. I learned to practice mindfulness and realized that triggers were just thoughts and nothing more. Centered helped me learn the skills necessary to function in daily life in a healthy way. The staff encouraged me every step of the way. Their caring and professionalism was top notch. I felt right at home and didn‚Äôt feel like I was being looked down upon. I would recommend Centered wholeheartedly to anyone seeking an alternative recovery program for addiction.
The program is Great!!! Revolutionary!!! It is awesome that is an alternative method of recovery so if you think the 12 step recovery is the only way. That's not the case. This is a Fresh new way of recovery. It's non 12-step. There should always be options what works for one might be horrible for the next. If you have went through 12 step recovery and find that your still struggling with whatever demons you may be having. Give the kind people at centered recovery a shot. It might be the call that forever changes you life.
"I first met Reed in Florida a few years ago and had a chance to experience a couple months of his program at Centered.  I had become a particularly nasty case of treatment resistant everything, so a change of perspective was necessary.  Centered aligned directly with my pre-existing beliefs on psychology and spirituality in relation to drug addiction, which validated the Truth I had tried to live all along (most of my prior experience was AA related). That Truth being that we are not inherently powerless, but the opposite. We are inherently powerful; understanding that is the key. If you are looking for an answer to the addiction question that is not satiated by traditional recovery, this is your place. If you have no knowledge of anything addiction or recovery related at all, this is still your place, as they will steer you in the direction that best suits your case. I can say with certainty that they are not interested in repeat customers. They want you to get your life together, move along, and enjoy the Freedom! In my case, I am grateful to Reed and what this new paradigm is doing because it assisted me in rediscovering and validating my own self-worth. This is simply invaluable to what I am achieving today. To those who are unsure of, or simply want more than the current standard in addiction treatment, this is the only place I would send anyone."
"This is an absolutely incredible program. People talk about things that ""Changed their Life"" or that something was life-changing. Usually that's hyperbole or temporary. Centered has changed my way of living and my understanding of life. Centered has permanently opened a door to a different dimension for me- I cannot unsee what I have seen and for that I am incredibly grateful. Furthermore, I now has a way of living where I can see infinite possibilities for growth and awareness.
I tried to make a go of it on my own for years searching for a solution to my severe drinking problem and only found temporary reprieves with AA and self-imposed will. I thought there was no way that I could escape my drinking to cope with what I perceived as life challenges and stress and that frankly I was a lost case.
What Centered has helped me to see and comprehend about my life and the world around me has been nothing short of miraculous. It is as though a switch has been thrown and I now have no desire or obsession to drink and alcohol has simply become a neutral thing. My view of life has completely shifted such that I no longer see the things that used to drive me to drink as problems or triggers. i've come to realize that it is not life that is messing with me but rather that it was my own interpretation of things and self-created persona that was causing a need to seek relief from suffering of my own creation.
My relationships with my wife and family are vastly better and improving regularly, my outlook on life and career have gone from negative to positive, and I am experiencing more authentic relationships with people and the world.
I came in ready to try anything, was completely open to whatever it was that would be taught or shown to me, and that I had to force myself to be patient with any kind of change or results. That mentality for me at least has allowed my investment in Centered to bring riches to my life that I never thought possible. One interesting and appealing thing to me is that discussion of alcohol or addiction is somewhat rare at Centered during the sessions and rather the focus and emphasis is on understanding and practicing a different way of living and perceiving life and which the natural by-product is to remove the things / thoughts that cause a person to drink, struggle with addiction, or generally be unhappy or stressed out. And as such, I would suggest that this program could be of enormous benefit for anyone whether or not you suffer from substance abuse and/or addiction.
Thank you Centered for ensuring that I will live a full, connected, and meaningful life :)"
"The folks at Centered Recovery are kind, compassionate and understanding for anyone looking to get help! This is also a great option for anyone that is looking for a recovery solution outside of traditional 12 step programs, focusing on mindfulness and learning to live outside of the reactive mindset that drugs and alcohol will often put the addict in! Great facility in a nice part of the Atlanta metro area."
"Centered saved me! The counselors are real. They address the who, what, when, where, and how of an issue while maintaining focus on the Present. I would recommend this program to ANYONE wishing to broaden their perspective in the world in which we co-create. I love this place!"
"This place was a blessing from the start! Reed was amazing!! When my boyfriend and I felt that we wouldn't be able to afford any programs or be able to find a program that would work for him (i.e. something other than the basic AA), I was told about Centered Recovery from his Aunt. When I contacted Reed, he immediately made us feel like this was the right place for Caleb to be, that he would be a prime participant and helped us with all of our barriers, so he could join the program. Within the first week, I could already see a 180 degree change in him and how the program was really helping him understand his issues. From the side of the significant other, supporting a partner who had a substance abuse issue, I never felt more hope that he would get through this journey. THIS PROGRAM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!! I do not know how I will ever pay them back for the help and support they gave Caleb during his time there, but I am tremendously grateful that they were with us all along the way! Caleb has now been sober since March 2018, and has gotten a second chance at life. Thank you Reed and everybody at Centered Recovery! We would not be where we are today, if it was not for your kindness, support, and love! Keep up the amazing work that you all do! <3"
"A unique approach to recovery, Centered offers an awareness and mindfulness based program.  By recognizing the nature of the mind, clients are empowered to transform introspection into action, and positively change patterns of perception and behavior."
"My husband struggled through traditional 12 step programs for years.  Centered Recovery provided a roadmap and a strategy that really resonated with him.  As a result, he is sober and our family has been helped tremendously.  I wish we had known about it sooner as we are all so much better off today than we have been in years."
"Centered offers a very interesting and novel take on the addiction recovery process. A varied mix of eastern philosophy and new age thinking, it is a welcome alternative to the traditional 12 step process. At first you may find it a little difficult to grasp, but I promise if you keep an open mind and give it a few visits- things will become more clear. Highly recommended for people who need a little more than AA."
"It was evident from my first experience with Centered Recovery that they are truly invested in their clients.  They have helped me to see my recovery with curiosity and I've learned to approach life with an inside-out perspective rather than being at the mercy from outside influences.  I've gained confidence in myself again and learned that the power has always been inside me, I just needed some gentle guidance and mindful reminders to get back on track.  I whole heartedly recommend Centered Recovery for anyone that is ready to take a REAL look at their lives and make a lasting change."
"Centered Recovery is a wonderful resource.  The staff and professionals there are truly top-notch.  They are very welcoming, patient, and attentive.  Centered helps everything run smoothly -- from insurance to online meetings.  They truly go above and beyond to help their patients reach their goals.  I truly enjoyed their approach to treatment; it is practical in many aspects of life, not just recovery."
I would like to thank Centered Recovery for helping me and my partner with our relationship. He has been going for about 3 to 4 weeks to Centered and I can tell a big difference with him.
"This program was life-changing. They offer more than what you need to be successful in your behavior changing incentives. I was skeptical that any rehab would seriously help but after attending their group sessions and being involved in the individual therapy i have more confidence and stability in my everyday life.  They do more than just help with addiction, they show you how you can live your life to fullest and I know that's cheesy but it couldn't be more true. Centered is the way to go!"
"I don't even know where to begin or how to describe the positive impact that Centered has had on my life, and therefore each member of my family's lives.  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I will echo other reviewers sentiments in saying that Centered Recovery is life changing.  The staff is comprised of the utmost professionals; I spoke to Reed on the phone before coming in to talk with them and enter the program.  I knew immediately I had come to the right place.  Their compassion for every individual there, no matter your circumstances, is evident from the beginning.  They are truly supportive and invested in each person's path to recovery.  Centered opened my eyes to a new perspective on life, and knowing myself on a deeper yet basic level of thought has allowed me to conquer what I would once have labeled anxiety and depression (along with the unhealthy mechanisms I was using to cope with those feelings.) .  After struggling for years with that anxiety, I can finally say I have the knowledge to approach life through a different lens - it was always there, but Reed, Colin, Krista and the rest of the staff helped show me the way to it.  I will forever be grateful I found them!

If you are seeking help for you or a loved one, at a place that doesn't put weight behind labels (addict, etc) and instead focuses on fundamental principles of life that can apply to ANYONE, then I suggest you run instead of walk to Centered.   You are not alone and they will only change your life for the better!"
"Okay so I've been on the recovery track for a few years now. And I've pretty much done it all. A couple months in outpatient, Almost 2 years in inpatient, Modern rehabs with yoga and surfing, backwoods bible based treatment, hundreds of 12-step meetings, medications, therapy, I mean the whole nine yards.
I'm now 29 years old, and the cumulative efforts I described above failed to give me the results I'm looking for. Namely the ability to find some space and peace inside my own mind, which has been a scary, nervous, hostile place for most of my life.
My therapist hooked me up with Centered Recovery and I started to attend the Thursday night sessions, and it really feels like the final piece that is helping everything else integrate into an experience of life that makes sense.
I don't have to check my brain at the door. I don't have to subscribe to any new philosophy. I simply show up, talk through various scenarios and begin to see things in a new way which is beautifully simple.
My work life, love life, and internal landscape of my mind have ALL IMPROVED after just a couple weeks!
I love these guys. Check it out."
"What can I say about Centered Recovery and the wonderful folks that have dedicated their lives to helping people overcome addiction and live their best life. Looking back at where I was a year ago vs. where I am at now is astounding. The program for me was more than just dealing with substance abuse issues but it has provided me with tools and an understanding of my thoughts, mind and body that extend into daily life. The mindfulness teachings and practices have given me tools to deal with stress and everyday life outside of recovery. The structure of the program was not intimidating nor did they ever make me feel like I was less of a person for having taken my life down a path that was not healthy or productive.

I cannot thank the team at CRP enough for being there for me and providing this wonderful program. The class structure is set up to allow you to be in a safe space with wonderful staff and I made several new friends with other participants and we continue to support each other.

If you are reading this and think you may need help please give them a call. They will listen, answer questions and support you from the 1st conversation. Please get the help you need from somewhere, but Centered Recovery's program will give you so much more than recovery from addiction. If nothing else come to one of their support group sessions that are open to the public and ask the folks for their opinion of the program and how it has helped them.

I am grateful every day for having gone to Centered Recovery and continue to be thirsty for knowledge to continue deepening the understanding of my mindfulness practice (life)."
"Having been through many treatment programs before, I was very skeptical coming to Centered Recovery and hoped at best to learn more about mindfulness. I honestly never thought any program would be able to help me stop drinking or to deal with life without alcohol. Through being at Centered, I have an entirely new way of relating to life and my own thoughts and feelings. I know that I don‚Äôt need alcohol in my life, which is something I never imagined myself saying. It‚Äôs really a miracle, and I‚Äôm very grateful to the staff at Centered for giving me back the happy and expansive life that was out of my reach for so many years."
"I owe both my recovery process and an immeasurable increase in quality of life to Centered. Their amazing approach and staff opened me up to a way of living that I didn't realize was possible. I came to them after years of struggling through other programs spanning multiple treatment centers, methods, etc. and nothing comes close to what I have gained and continue to gain through Centered. The insights I've had as a result of this program positively influence my life each and every day and is highly recommended for anyone looking to make a deep and powerful change!"
"I was really thankful to find this program and group of people. It was refreshing to be with like-minded intellectual people. This is not a 12-step. If you are interested in mindfulness and improving your overall lifestyle/thought process, this is an excellent program for that. The leaders of the group are welcoming. You can try it out with a free group session. I am definitely returning for more sessions."
"Centered Recovery is an outstanding facility with an exceptional staff. I have been lucky enough to spend a lot of time with the owners of the facility and I would recommend this facility to anyone who is looking to either start their recovery journey, or to anyone that has been in recovery and is looking to expand their understanding and personal recovery. It is a mindfulness based recovery model that has helped me gain an understanding of myself and personal experiences in so many ways. If I could give them 20 stars I would do so. Amazing people doing amazing things for so many people including myself. Thank you all for everything. that you have done for me and so many others!!!

With Gratitude

"Centered Recovery has gone above and beyond all expectations.  It was my first time receiving help for my drug and alcohol problems and they helped me every step of the way.  They are truly caring individuals who love seeing their patients succeed.  They helped me get into a detox program, teach me that stresses in life are created in my thoughts, and helped me make a plan once my program was completed.

I went to a few NA meetings and hated the negative atmosphere.  ""You'll always be an addict"" just didn't make sense to me if you could be clean and sober for years and not have any cravings to use.  I had plenty of clean time to know that I just needed help to get through this and then get back to a place where I didn't need a substance to ""help"" me.

Centered recovery is such a positive atmosphere because addictions are rarely brought up.  What centered recovery focuses on is what caused addictions to start and ultimately control your life.  They give you tools to get out of the rock-bottoms of life and help you practice them in every day situations.  These tools can help anyone at any point in life accept whatever problems they may be having, and overcome them.  I highly recommend coming to one of their sessions if you have any desire or thought about receiving help and don't know where to get it.  I really think this program can help almost anybody who gives it a try."
"Centered Recovery is an incredibly useful program. If one was to find oneself in a state where they had no where else to go and no rock to cling to they should give this program a try, be it addiction, depression, or just a general sense that not all is well with the world.

If you go into it openly the Centered staff will expose you to something which has the ability to grant ever lasting peace independent of what happens to you in the world or any ideas you may have about that world. The possibility that what I propose could actually happen to you, its gotta be worth giving it a try right?"
"Review based on attendance in support meetings:
I visited Centered Recovery for one of their mindfulness support meetings about 9 months into my sobriety, looking for a place to connect with others after deciding to stop attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. I wanted to continue to have and give support in a group setting. Now, I attend one of these support meetings almost every week. While I will forever be grateful for Alcoholic Anonymous as part of my recovery path and see so much value in much of the 12 step program, I never felt that it hit the mark. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I was sober and have stayed sober from alcohol thus far, but I was not happy living life from that lens. I never felt comfortable calling myself an alcoholic and it felt inauthentic to say it so often. Also, I felt like a lot was missing in my recovery. I call myself a seeker and I was on a quest to find solutions to what was missing. I found these answers and continue to seek and find them in multiple places from several different pathways, but these support meetings at Centered Recovery support all of that. They allow for open questioning, discussion, and respect and allow for multiple pathways, even those that follow the 12 step pathway. They are not interested in labels and more interested in what is at the root of the feeling, emotion, or perception. The level of vulnerability that I witness in these meetings is monumental. We come together with an idea that we are all human beings living a human experience and we all need to work towards cultivating a more honest relationship with the self. Also, I feel like many recovery communities often teach us to distrust ourselves initially, but at Centered I‚Äôve found people that encourage each other to pause and look inward for the answers that were there all along. We all have a great intuition and tapping into this has been a huge part of my recovery. I love that I can talk about these experiences at Centered Recovery and continue to build knowledge, hope, and courage with others on this journey that is life."
"Centered has truly changed my life. I don‚Äôt typically write reviews, but this place has taught me a fundamentally new way of operating in life and really helped me find the answers within myself I had been searching for in all the wrong places for years. Having never been to a recovery program before, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect on my first day of classes at Centered and absolutely was NOT expecting to #1. learn anything new that I hadn‚Äôt already read in self-improvement/personal growth/psychology books throughout the years or #2. be affected by the support of others leading and participating in the program. I cannot tell you how shocked I was after the first day of classes were over-pleasantly surprised would be an understatement!! I couldn‚Äôt believe the energy in the room and how welcoming it felt right away. I‚Äôll never forget that feeling on the first day walking in and being aware of that comfort energy. I not only sat and listened (and I mean REALLY listened b/c what was being taught resonated such truth to me), but I also participated in the classroom discussions,  much to my own surprise, as I was not intending on ‚Äúgoing there‚Äù with people I did not know. How amazing that my perception was so wrong, and on that first day felt comfortable to share vulnerabilities about myself openly in class. It was so rewarding in a way I had not expected.
This program has helped me to implement mindfulness into my day-to-day life and simplified how the mind works in a way that has made all the difference for me. Coming from living a very fast-paced life where I never felt like I could ‚Äúde-stress‚Äù and turn my over-active mind off, it is incredible that I have found a community that has taught me to truly slow down and live each day more fully, leading to a drastically healthier lifestyle and happier overall existence!
If you are seeking to learn how to live in the present moment daily, reduce anxiety/depression from ruminating thoughts, and generally live a more content life then Centered WILL help you! Very grateful that I was led to this program and can‚Äôt say enough about the powerful positive effects it has had on me!"
Centered is not like any other program.  More intellectually thought provoking and introspective that becomes part of who you are.  Highly recommend as stand alone support or combined with other types of programs for a complete experience.
"Before i discovered Centered Recovery i was honestly at the point where i never thought i could obtain sobriety. My life fell apart and i hit the lowest of all lows but after coming here i can see a significant change in every aspect of my life.  After being to multiple rehabs i wish i would have come across Centered sooner. I can confidently say this program has opened up a whole new world to me. I no longer feel the need to use drugs for all my problems. There is an incredible weight lifted off my shoulders and for the first time i can say that i am excited to be sober.  Words can not describe how grateful i am for this program. It is pretty much a miracle in my eyes. The staff is extremely special in my opinion, every single staff member has a genuine passion for what they do and you can sense it. To say that i highly recommend Centered Recovery is an understatement."
"Thank you Centered Recovery! Our son has attended several rehab programs BUT NONE LIKE THIS ONE! We have seen an incredible change in his life and his attitude towards staying sober. You have empowered him to believe in himself and that he can stay sober, and by doing this for him you have changed our whole family! This has been a very long journey, and now we feel we not only see light at the end of the tunnel, but that we are at the very end of the tunnel and in the light. Thank you! We will live in gratefulness for all you have done for us."
"Centered Recovery is a gem. The staff is knowledgeable, helpful, and respectful. There are a lot of treatment centers that recycle and reuse material solely for financial gain. This is not one of them. The content is unique and original. Thought provoking ideas and conversations occur everyday here. They focus on the true root of any problem you can imagine - thought. Some therapies focus on making goals and recognizing reoccurring behaviors; and while that is very relevant it misses what comes before that- Thought processes and how we experience and perceive the world. It's very normal to take thoughts quite seriously (even destructive ones) yet they are all synapses that occur constantly in the brain. If it sounds weird - good. Call them. They are very professional and friendly."
"Centered Recovery is such a great program! Their unique, yet effective approach towards recovery helped me see the bigger picture, and continue my journey of sobriety. Each and every staff member was very friendly towards me, and I greatly appreciate all of the things they taught me. A special thanks to Reed, Mayer, and Matt as I spent most of my time there with them, y'all are the best :-)"
"I have never been to Centered Recovery but my partner has been attending for several months now. Since then, he has been more mindful, focused, and at peace. He is, for lack of a more creative word, more centered than he ever has been! He comes home every Thursday night with a renewed sense of satisfaction and inner tranquility. We communicate more mindfully, and with greater awareness and respect for one another. His work in 12 Step and Non-12 Step Programs are always beneficial when we are supporting each other, but I believe Centered Recovery has something special to offer to couples.

Centered Recovery and Reed have enhanced his recovery journey and I would strongly recommend that *everyone* should check it out."
"If you are looking for a true change, behaviorally, then Centered is where you need to be.  This place is truly life-changing, and I have learned so much just in these few, short months I have been attending the group sessions.  Reed, Colin, and their team have taught me to view and appreciate the world with a new innocence, almost as if through the eyes of a child, my child, who just turned 12 months old in June.  I have a whole new appreciation for life and have learned that thoughts are just thoughts, good, bad, or indifferent.  The tools I have learned will be forever remembered and used, and you too can learn the necessary tools to overcome what has been far too common in your life for so long.

There is so much joy in my life again, and I have this newfound respect and joy in life, and it's thanks to Centered.  They have taught me how it's possible to gain control of my life again, and I now get to be a reliably dependent individual and can now be there for my family, as well as our little boy.  Centered is truly an amazing place, so if you are looking for a place that is different than anything and everything else you've tried, or are a first-timer like me, then please give your life another chance and #getcentered."
"I am very blessed and grateful to be a part of the amazing clinical team at Centered Recovery! Thank you Reed and Krista for your expertise, openness, wisdom, and kindness. I noticed an immediate connection when we met, and I knew this place was special. As a counselor and practitioner of meditation and mindfulness, I am blown away by the services we provide to our clients. Witnessing their ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù moments of transformation and change is inspiring! Thank you for all that you do :-)!"
"Centered has been life changing for me...in all areas of my life; physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. My mind is opening and expanding. I am able to sit in the present without judgement of myself, and just be. This process continues to progress for me. It has taken me some time to have insights. I live with chronic physical pain, so many of my thoughts were focused on grieving the past and fear of the future, though today I live in the now. I accept myself and love myself...finally! I am extremely grateful to all of the staff at Centered Recovery! They also worked with me financially, which was huge for me!"
"World changing program.  Don't have to listen to a plethora of emotional roller coaster testimonials.  Emphasis is placed on understanding what is going on in the brain when stress, anxiety and emotions are happening, and how to experience these without the negative outcomes generally associated with these.    The atmosphere is very peaceful and calming, very zen like.  Your perspective of yourself and the world will  change."
Absolutely outstanding in EVERY way!  TRULY LIFE ALTERING and I wish I could give Reid and the team 11 Stars! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
"For the majority of my life I have struggled with mental health issues compounded by serious substance abuse disorders. I enrolled with my life on the line. It has now been saved.

The environment, staff, and curriculum at centered has had a more profound and lasting effect on my life than anything I have ever experienced. None of the multitudes of treatments and medications I've tried for decades come close to this program.

Words cannot express my gratitude."
"This place and these people have changed my life in a way that is hard to put into words. Through their teachings of mindfulness, I finally have a sense of direction in my life and I have found answers to questions that I didn't know I had. The program is amazing and the progress I've made with their support is baffling. The staff goes above and beyond for each one of us every single day. They're here to help you for the right reasons."
"Centered Recovery helped me immensely when I was at a low point in my life. The staff really cares and wants you to succeed. It took a little while to grasp, but with the help of Reed and the rest of the staff my overall life improved a ton. I would recommend this program to anyone struggling. I am able to apply the things I learned to my daily life. Nothing was forced on me and I was able to learn at my own pace and ask as many questions as I wanted. Thank y‚Äôall!"
"I have been attending Centered Recover since mid January 2020 and the information taught and provided has been the most helpful and impactful to my recovery so far.  I have been through three inpatient treatment centers and other outpatient, but what I have gained about mindfulness at Centered with Reed, Mike, Collin and Brittany is truly helping my happiness and sobriety!!!!Rusty"
"I had begun to lose hope. I had been to treatment before. The same old stuff kept getting peddled to me: 12 steps, God, sponsors, etc. It seems irresponsible to promote ""a way to get sober"" that has so little scientific backing. I understand that method helps some people and that's great, but for me it just wasn't working. And it wasn't just the alcohol; if anything, that was a symptom of a greater problem with depression, anxiety, and other issues with which I had been poorly coping throughout my life. Then I found Centered Recovery. They took a scientific approach that worked to get to the root of why I choose to drink. They taught me the neglected skill of Awareness in my day to day life that truly began to alter my thinking for the better. For the first time, I was aware of the message my body was already communicating to me: ""You're miserable. You know this isn't helping."" I saw so clearly what alcohol was doing to my mind and body. So, I stopped drinking because *I* chose to stop. Not because I was chasing some delusion in 12 separate steps that a Power Greater Than Myself will suddenly turn my life around in a pragmatic way. I went to Catholic school all my life and already knew that wasn't true. Centered Recovery taught me realistic techniques to practice awareness in mind and body and (as corny or BS as it sounds),  I am truly a better person and a proud non-drinker. I can't recommend nor commend this institution more highly. If you have the means and want to get better, please consider this a realistic and prime option to building a better life."
"A few months ago I had hit rock bottom.  I was going through a divorce and my drinking had started getting out of control because of my anxiety and depression.  I had never had an issue with the alcohol a prior to the divorce, but realized that I was fast tracking myself to a bad point my life. Unfortunately I ended up getting in trouble and in my research I came across Centered Recovery.  When I spoke with Reed it was completely different then all of the other places I had looked into.  He genuinely was concerned about me and where my mind was and why I was doing what I was doing as opposed to the drinking itself.  After being there a few months I can honestly say that what happened to me was meant to happen and I'm forever grateful for running into Reed and his program.  I am completely different person and everything I learned at Centered has not only made me a better man but I can apply it to every facet of my life.  It has saved me and it saved my relationship with my family, my kids, and even my ex-wife.  I will forever be grateful for what Centered has done for me and hope that everybody that needs help will come here and learn how to understand themselves. My anxiety is gone and I have learned that is not a disease and I can control how I react to things and not one I feel and think is totally OK.  Thank you to everybody in this program is truly a blessing. I will forever be a better man because of it."
"In a city home to some of the original pillars of treatment as we know it, Centered Recovery shows up in a very fresh and very relevant way. Offering an alternative to 12 modalities, Centered's approach is built upon mindfulness, but this is only the beginning. These folks are truly do amazing work and offer solutions that work!"
"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about Centered Recovery.  I had spent about 40 days in rehab/sober living and didn‚Äôt make much progress and was still white knuckling the 12 step program.  After 3 sessions with Centered recovery, yes just 9 hours,  I felt better than I had in years.  They showed me a whole new approach to my thinking and gave me the tools to manage my addiction without the help of a sponsor or re-living my past problems every single day.  I have been given my life back and am working on rebuilding my relationship with my family thanks to their help.  I am now energized and enjoy going to sessions.  Things that used to cause me significant stress and anxiety that led to my drinking are no longer controlling me. I have a sense of freedom that gives me the confidence that even when tough times come my way again I can now manage in a healthy fashion.  I am present in the here and now and accept things as they are and it makes all the difference in the world.  Please take advantage of this program - it can change your life.  It has changed mine and I will be forever grateful to the team there for what they have given me.  I wish I had found them years ago.  If I had a friend or a family member struggling I would send them there in a heartbeat.  Best of luck and hope to see you there."
"There is no way to express how happy I am to see my son healthy again!   We are his biggest fans and would do anything for him.  The therapy and education they provided him turned his life around in a matter of a few weeks!
We are so grateful to Centered Recovery and especially Reed Smith. After finding out my son had a substance abuse addiction, Reed and his team helped us through the whole process in such a caring atmosphere.  They have provided him with individual counseling, group counseling/teachings, and unlimited advice at anytime.  It is such a positive and caring program! They figured out a plan so he could continue working full-time.  They also pointed us in the right direction for detox, doctors and information.  I feel blessed that we stopped in to talk to Reed."
"It is due to Reed Smith that I not only recovered my life but am also THRIVING in my life. I have recovered in ways I would have never imagined. The knowledge and incredible insights this program offers allowed me to completely overcome my addictions to both alcohol and drugs. Reed and Krista have the biggest hearts and work diligently with you to ensure you feel supported and safe throughout each step of your personal recovery process. It is worth noting that if you are ready to take back your life, this program provides you all the power within YOURSELF to do so. Be proud of yourself for taking these steps and trust in the good work Reed and his great team are providing. I have no doubts that like myself, you will be amazed."
"Centered Recovery has been amazing in all aspects!  Everyone on the staff is genuine and actually care about each individuals recovery and needs.  I struggled with Opiate addiction for about a year prior to attending Centered.  I can truly say without a doubt,  Centered has given me the tools and knowledge to achieve  long-term sobriety and heal the relationships I damaged in the process of my addiction.  I had no idea how effective Mindfulness could be to my overall health and outlook on life.  I am truly grateful for the opportunity and experience that Centered Recovery has given to myself and my family.  Anyone looking for a non 12 step program that is effective and positive,  please look no further!"
"Centered Recovery- it‚Äôs almost hard to put into words the amazing thing that‚Äôs happening here. A different approach to recovery that‚Äôs changed my life. These guys are very authentic and and genuinely care about each and every person that steps through the doors. I‚Äôve never experienced anything like it. If anyone is struggling, this is the place to turn to."
"Centered Recovery has been such a blessing in my life.  This facility, teachers, and counselors have been instrumental in my recovery and are all top notch in my eyes. The teaching of Mindfulness has changed my life for the better and I am so thankful."
"Centered Recovery brings back the humanity to individuals; remove all the labels and judgements that are created from thoughts, feelings, and reactions and come back to the original state of being.  It‚Äôs never too late to come back to yourself and grow into the future with a new point of view and depth of wellness."
"For a very long time I thought that the main problem that was keeping me from achieving anything in life was my ongoing battle with addiction to drugs and alcohol. What had started out as a simple love affair proceeded forward into a systematic masochistic destruction of my outer and inner worlds. When I was first introduced to drugs and alcohol I became aware that these two things were a solution to a problem I had not known that I had. 10 years later I had forgotten that these things were a solution and had fallen under the assumption that they were actually the problem. I attempted to get sober on my own multiple times, and had also tried the 12 step approach without any success. If you removed the alcohol and drugs I was left with the original problem. Then I found centered recovery and ultimately the solution to the the problem I had not known I had. Reed, Krista, Mayer, and all of the other team members at centered recovery opened up my eyes to a whole new world that had been sitting right in front of me this whole time. It was the lifetime of conditioning that had filtered my lens to the world, and they were able to help me begin to clear my vision once again. At centered recovery I not only found the way to stop drinking and  using but I also found a way to live my life fully and openly. I began to see light in my dreary world and eventually found the peace and joy that had always been waiting for me. All I had to do was look. If you are deciding on where to go and what to do to get sober... if you have tried alone and failed... if the 12 steps were not for you... if you want to learn how to be happy in a world that seems completely against you... then I suggest you make the best decision you can for your present situation and future, and give centered recovery a try. It might just save your life. I know it saved mine."
"Reed and Krista are, in no less words, miracle workers! I have worked with them for a few years and was always inspired by the calm presence that came from them. They helped show me a new way of looking at perspective and how we view the world. It not only helped me as a counselor, but helped me as a person as well. I have taken their insights and applied them to daily life. Also, Reed has a plethora of book recommendations! I highly recommend that if you are looking for treatment that you reach out to them!"
Reed is one of the smartest men I have ever had the privilege to meet. he has help me out so much I could never thank him enough. his recovery facility looks and feels better than a 5 star hotel. I mean the inside is very 2017! and if you thought your house built in 2000 is modern you have seen nothing yet!
"As the Son, Grandson, Brother, Nephew, etc., of many individuals labeled as alcoholics, I saw what I believed ""recovery"" to look like. When I reached a point where I felt I needed help with my own drinking, Centered was referred to me by a friend who I trusted, and also knew had a similar background to myself. I went to Centered for two weeks, and I felt that I came out of that time 10 years more intelligent than when I arrived.

What one learns at Centered is not how to deal with your addiction, rather how to deal with your thought. Not just thought on addiction, but all the thoughts you have during the day that can carry you into a mental state of unrest, which leads most into the physical consequences of addiction. Reed, Krista, Mayer, Bridget, and (both!) Lauren helped me gain a perspective on my thought that not only helped my addictive qualities, but my mental peace.

Seeing my family members come out of a traditional recovery program for addition, I saw them feel better, but often enough they were not able to retain the mental peace in order to stay on their newfound ""path."" With Centered Recovery, you learn how to get on the path, and how to stay there."
"I came to Centered Recovery because I was intrigued by the concept of mindfulness as a path to recovery.  I was hopeful that the program would help me understand the psychology behind my addictive thinking and behavior. I was searching for a way to stay sober.  What actually happened is unbelievable. The principles of Mind, Thought, and Consciousness have not only provided the framework for maintaining sobriety, but also have changed the way I see myself and the world. What a gift it is to not be caught up in thoughts of the past regret or future anxiety.  The state of  being awake and centered in the present moment is truly wonderful.  I cannot thank Reed, Krista, Mayer, Lauren, Lauren, Bridget, Jess and everyone at Centered enough for opening my eyes. You are rockstars!  I wholeheartedly recommend Centered Recovery for anyone dealing with addiction."
"I went to Centered Recovery, because I wanted an alternative to AA. Centered has changed my life. It has saved my life. I didn't know what Mindfulness exactly meant, but I have learned it is the connection I needed to help me stay sober. Through Mindfulness, changing my thoughts, and my conscious I have learned to face my fears and change them. Centered has helped me achieve things in my life that I wanted. My relationships with my husband, my children, my family and everyone in my life.has dramatically improved. I am  more HAPPY than I have ever been before in my life. I highly recommended Centered Recovery to make the changes in your life."
"Centered recovery is definitely a life changing experience. I have struggled with heroin for 14 years and I thought I was hopeless, a lost cause, and overall never going to make it. Until I met Reed, he helped open my mind to show me I already have all the tools I need to make my life happy. He also showed me that happiness is a choice. I had a tough time grasping it but now that I have completed the program it all makes total sense and it's really easy after you get rid of the chaos tornado in your life. I can't thank you enough, I hope other people are lucky enough to grasp what I now have."
"Centered Recovery literally saved our sons life. After 2 other attempts at other rehab centers,  we learned of Centered Recovery, in Roswell Ga. It wasn't your typical 12 step, it has classes and counseling,, group and individual, that taught him how to live addiction free! The way they teach, and the new way of thinking, that he never knew before, helped him to be confident, to be drug, and alcohol free ! He has been there for 7 months now, and is working towards a degree in helping others. Its such a relief, talking to him every day and hearing how happy and confident he is now!  The staff also keeps in touch with me and is always willing to talk when I have questions, they also call me just to say how well he is doing, and how proud they are! To me that is remarkable!I can't thank the loving and caring staff there enough , that truly care about our son, They have become like a new family to him. If you are looking for a new way of recovery for yourself or someone you love, you should try Centered Recovery, you won't be disappointed!!"
"The most powerful thing I can say about this program is that you wouldn't be reading this review without it.  I am alive.  I am healthy.  I am happy.  Thank you.  I can't even write this without crying grateful tears.  Thank you.
Change is hard at first but once change becomes your new healthy habit....life is GOLD!"
"I had tried to get sober for two years doing the 12 step program.  Centered Recovery changed my life.  I became aware of my thoughts, feelings, and reactions.  It is amazing how simple it really is to live a happy healthy life.  This was a life changing experience.  I learned who I was and how I experience life.  They taught me a better way to live."
"I was in a place of dispair and hopelessness. I had lost all passion and was struggling with addiction. I‚Äôve been to inpatient facilities for 90 days and came out feeling the same as when I first entered the program. After a lot of research my wife told me about Centered Recovery. I reluctantly came and before I knew it, I began to notice changes in my thinking. They allowed me to gain insights into my self without pressure. You don‚Äôt feel like a number. The counselors create a very therapeutic environment through mindfulness and meditation. Becoming aware is one of the greatest gifts of all.
I thank you all sincerely.

"I wish I could give infinite stars! I don‚Äôt only owe my sobriety to this program but my SANITY. Where 12 step, counseling, hypnotherapy and even drug therapy failed me, Centered Recovery succeeded me. I am no longer bound to addiction, or an ‚Äúaddict‚Äù mentality, but I am reconnected with a sense of self control, inner peace, power in communication and tools to manage my mental and EMOTIONAL health. I call this my ‚Äútrouble-shooting‚Äù school, as it is set up in a student/learner environment. The curriculum is not suppressive but empirically confrontational, informing clients about the relationship between the mind and body, which is integral to the foundation of the program. As someone who appreciates the wonders of spirit and the steadfastness of science, I found their methods of teaching were paramount to my recovery. Even the other attending clientele regularly raved about their constant progress made using Centered's methods.The owners, therapists, facilitators, medical staff and even clientele are simply delightful. The facility is clean, beautiful and accommodating.  From the application process to my last day, I was respected and encouraged. I was on a first name basis with the staff, and I could tell they intently strived to get to know me and each attending client. I honestly always looked forward to my sessions, as I attended IOP. If you or a loved one are considering Centered for a form of addiction treatment, then stop your search. I will advise, for those who have tirelessly tried to recover, you must be ready for the resolution Centered has to offer. You must be willing to accept and learn about the reality that is and is not in your control. Just show up, follow your treatment plan, and I promise that your life will be permanently changed for the better."
"If you are looking for a place to help show you the way to truly changing your life for the better, saying I highly recommend Centered Recovery doesn‚Äôt do it justice.  Like many people who are in similar situations, I really needed help but until I came and (I guess) graduated from Centered, my thinking on what the help I needed looked like isn‚Äôt close to what I experienced.  In my mind the very thought of not drinking came with many illusions around how impossible that would be to maintain, how would I be able to have fun again, how can would I be able to go out with friends ever again without feeling uncomfortable and struggle watching them drink...no way I could ever be around alcohol ever again because it would be to hard!  What you learn at Centered is a very deep connection to how our experiences happen‚Äîhow the inside system works that creates these experiences, and as long as you are open to an honest look to what‚Äôs happening inside, they help you discover that what happens on the outside can‚Äôt touch you.  This understanding that I was guided to by the people that I truly consider friends now, goes beyond being able to stop drinking or any kind of substance abuse.  Instead a much greater understanding that leads to life being lived in such a free way with less stress, worry, anxiety, ETC becomes a reality. If you‚Äôre reading this you‚Äôre either in a similar place I was (really need help.  desperate to be happy and not controlled by something that feels completely out of your control) or you‚Äôre reading this looking for options for someone you care about, please call Centered Recovery.  It will be the best decision you‚Äôve made in your life, and if you‚Äôre truly open and ready, it will feel like the beginning of your life."
Centered Recovery has been a lifesaver for our son .He called about 10 weeks ago to say he was an alcoholic and needed help. Enrolled him at Centered Recovery and he is back to his old self. He is happy and working at a new job. We see hope for his future. We know Centered will be there for him in case of a relapse. We highly recommend their treatment program.
"I called and spoke with Reed last fall,  voice shaking,  knowing I'd been defeated in my battle with alcohol.   Reed helped me find a rehab/detox facility,  and I attended Centered Recovery directly after discharge.   After not getting very far with AA, Reed (and his staff!) showed me an avenue of recovery that I didn't know was available to me.  Within my sessions,  I began to see how being mindful of my thoughts gave me the freedom I'd truly been craving.   Thanks,  guys!"
"The Experience to the way of Recovery.

I have fallen in love with what cannot not be explained and that is the recovering experience at Centered Recovery. It just seemed like a thought ago I was suicidal, depressed, and worst of all bored with life in life‚Äôs entirety. However, when I started thinking the Centered way I found that being sober was and is an effortless, natural experience life offers to me everyday.

My thoughts at centered has created my reality to be greater than what any thought outside of recovery at centered could be creatively created to be. Creating my reality through thought then and only when is what, when it could be greater than what was destined to be. Now me, being alive because of Centered Recovery has paved a path so naturally painlessly.

Following the centered recovery flow is letting and going, and I am Now Being. Just being able to let go by being in the now was before the past, after the future, then mutually arises together in time to foreverness of being forever present mindfully.

Centered recovery is to all as it is to me; However, I perceive Centered recovery as an indescribably description that explains these-‚ÄúHow to be Centered in life‚Äù-rivers that lead me to believe in being and being centered without meaning and without having a reason too, leads me graciously with gratitude to this blissful ocean of naturally letting me go without premeditated thought of telling myself or letting myself know what it is that I am doing or about to be for without self there is no power in willpower in just doing but power in just being.

LoL üòá

Not being me for a change gives me freedom to dream and live freely mindfully. Inside my body I can mindfully feel my mind as part of the body and not how I perceive it to be without my body.

This teaches me that traveling along recovery inside in centered is the acceptance of knowing that there is everything in understanding the knowing of value has value with balanced polarized boundaries in place.

Centered Recovery is amazing and has changed my perspectives on life and what it means to show in the world.

I praise my lord and savior Jesus Christ for sending me the boat Centered Recovery to metaphorically save me from the destructive thoughts that had me in such a dilemma I could not live life anymore.

"Having spent time in programs such as 12 step, SMART, Refuge, etc., based mostly on utilizing outside forces to combat the issues which bring so many into these rooms, I found solace in Centered because it teaches us to understand the root of all of our issues which exist within our own minds. And rather than relying on rules or strategies, others, or even other ""higher powers,"" the basis here is that you, the individual, can learn not to self perpetuate harmful or unhealthy behaviors. With these sensibilities and strengths at your disposal, slowly you will free yourself from those behaviors and in a positive direction which is more true to your core self, that which you are meant to be. Living a burdensome life in series after series of poor choices, misdirected fear/anger, and many other examples can become exactly what they are - in the past and therefore no longer likely in the future. Focusing on the present, the here and now, is where our minds are best programmed to be. Once that is fully realized and built upon, all of those unnecessary fears and anxieties will begin to drop off piece by piece at your convenience. This new strength will not only apply to what brought you here, but to all facets of life where once the mind could cause suffering, now will become your best tool in realizing the joys of life. After all, when we are completely stripped down, all we have is our mind. Centered will put you on the path to finally liberate it, return hope to your existence, and see more clearly your consciousness and its fullest potential."
"I have been to every expensive treatment center in the Atlanta area and a few in Florida. I found recovery in 2004 and I have struggled for many years and was able to put together 3 years of sobriety twice.

That being said, I‚Äôve had my difficulty‚Äôs with the rooms of AA and I even tried ‚ÄúAndy Stanley‚Äôs‚Äù Buckhead Church. Nothing seemed to stick long term. I did find spiritual growth for a short period of time practicing the ‚ÄúLaw of Attraction‚Äù. However, it proved to be a difficult daily task that I started to dread as opposed to looking forward too. So that only lasted about 3 months.

Then in the summer of 2019 I found Centered Recovery. It was a true eye opening experience. It was clearly the missing piece that all off the other spiritually programs were lacking and still do in my opinion. Let me tell you why...

The missing component for me had to do with learning more about what is true and what is false centered around the power of ‚ÄúTHOUGHT‚Äù. So, what do I mean?

The uncontrollable free flowing consciousness of ‚Äúperceived‚Äù negative thoughts is something that has been running wild in my mind for years. Worrying and reliving my ghosts from the past, as well as projecting unproven experiences of the future. At Centered Recovery you will learn, such as I did, an in-depth perspective on the true meaning behind our daily thoughts and how to understand and conceptualize how to accept, alter, understand, learn truth vs. false, and even manifest thought.

To go deeper, this practice of Philosophy has truly helped me, someone who is addicted learn how the labeling of the world around me is ONLY a manifestation of my own individual thoughts, core beliefs, judgements, and any other layer of my personality that brings SUFFERING into my life. This is the nucleus of Centered Recovery, but you will learn a new deeper understanding of what to do in time of crisis when you are alone and having thoughts that do not serve you in a positive way.

After all, isn‚Äôt the main objective in life especially dealing with addiction to minimize ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù and to add peace and contentment into ones life?

If you want what grabbed me without me having to grab it, try Centered Recovery.

"Great program and awesome staff.  The owner goes out of his way to assist and ensure you have everything you need to find mindful balance in your life.  I have struggled my entire life with various forms of abuse and until now i didn't think I would ever be able to do anything about it.  I have tried other programs that just address the symptoms, ignoring the root issues.  Their simple approach is always laughable once you figure it out, and makes you wonder why you couldn't get to this conclusion in life on your own. My only regret is not finding this place sooner, it has literally changed my life, how I view myself and the world around me.  I can't thank them enough.  #ItsJustaThought"
"Useless, they don‚Äôt talk about drug or alcohol use or addiction. They feed right into all the denial.   I saw no change in my husband and he was drinking again before the six week program ended.  And it‚Äôs expensive, they don‚Äôt take insurance.  Stay away and find a real recovery program."
"Such an Amazing place! I can't say enough positive things about Centered. I have been really struggling with addiction for over 25 years. I have suffered with anxiety for as long as I can remember.  The only thing that would help with the anxiety was alcohol.  I have been on medication for my anxiety but it only helped a little, I still suffered daily and the alcohol took my anxiety away.  Needless to say I had to increase the alcohol to get the same feeling and we all know that never ends well.  I went to 3 different inpatient rehab facilities.  After a tremendous amount of money, and time away from my family it never worked for more than a month after I got back home.  I was sober but my anxiety was still there and I would end up drinking again. I have also been to more 12 step meetings than I can count and they never did anything to help me.   I have also tried different medications to help me stop drinking and they did not help either.  I kept telling anyone that would listen that I really wanted some how to ""change my brain""!!  I knew 12 steps, rehab, detox, medication, white knuckle, threats, losing everything I had, etc did not work.  Well, after learning about Centered Recovery Program, I really wanted to try it because it ""seemed ""like what I was looking for.  It was SO MUCH MORE than what I was looking for. I am not only sober but I don't even think about drinking at all anymore.  My anxiety is GONE!!!!!!  I no longer take any anxiety medication and they have taught me how to live anxiety free.  I actually learned that after the first week of being at Centered. I could go on and on about how this place changed my life, but you really need to try if for yourself.  My husband who is a skeptic about almost everything is a true believer because he has seen the change in me. I LOVE the entire team at Centered, not only are they all truly some of the most intelligent people I have ever met but they all are so ""normal"" and so much fun.  I wish I could keep coming every day!! Love this place!! I highly recommend you try Centered, you have nothing to lose except your addiction, fears, crappy thinking, past traumas,anxiety, etc!!"
"I HAVE MY SON BACK!!! ""Thank You"" does not seem appropriate enough for changing the life of a whole family. You ALL have literally Saved A Life and changed the path we all have been on for a long time. Because of the program and amazing staff at Centered , my son has become empowered, changed course and now realizes his true potential in life! You all have given him the encouragement and confidence to pursue his passions. You have enabled him to find the strength and insight that he forgot he had all along! Because of the care and compassion of the  entire staff, he now has the ability to move forward without looking back. He was on a self destructive path and could not find his way out of the guilt and shame he carried.He has learned to leave the labels and judgement behind and now only looks ahead to what can and will be. His excitement and happiness in everyday life is something that has been missing for a long time. When he came to us asking for help, I knew I only had a small window of time to find the right place. I HAD to get it right...or possibly lose him forever. Thankfully I discovered this AMAZING place and felt from that very first phone call that my son would be in good hands!! I truly appreciate the support and genuine care and concern that EVERYONE at Centered has shown to my son and family. If you or a loved one is ready to change paths in life, please call Centered!  They are NOT a 12-Step program, and are unlike any other programs that I know of! It is a POSITIVE Mindfulness program that helps you to recognize the barriers that are blocking YOUR path! You will learn how to leave all the labels, judgments and negativity in the past! My son now looks FORWARD to each and every day with new direction! We could not be prouder of him and are so thankful that he found his way back!! We will all be Forever Grateful to Each and Everyone of you at Centered! With Sincerer gratitude and a heartfelt ""THANK YOU"" to ALL of you for EVERYTHING you do!"
"It's very difficult to explain in words how Centered Recovery Programs has changed my life forever. I tried many ways and methodologies to fight anxiety and the problems that come with it over the last 20 years. On most occasions there was temporary success but it never really felt like it would last. Reed and the team of highly skilled professionals at CRP showed me a new way to face my problems.

They have helped me understand how I can lead a wonderful and peaceful life filled with love. The program focuses on many key issues such as acceptance, living in the moment, being fully aware and observant of your surroundings, and not fighting or controlling waves of difficulty but embracing them for what they are.

For anyone one out there who feels like depression, anxiety, or addiction have taken control of their lives there is an answer. You are not alone and can't think you can face and beat these difficult problems by yourself. Centered Recovery Programs can not only teach you how to overcome your affliction but it can show you the path to true happiness and a wonderful life!"
"GAME CHANGER! Or should I say game over. That‚Äôs what this place amounts to. With the help of the good folks at Centered I was able to see that the solution to my problems were not ‚Äúout there‚Äù but within me. I know that sounds cheesy but damnit it‚Äôs true. I was given the information I needed to understand myself and the constant silly games my ego plays. And the only (and absolutely easiest) way to really win is not to play. Because my life, my well-being, and my happiness is not a friggin game! FULL DISCLOSURE: These are my words and thoughts, the professionals who run things are not nearly this cliche and groan worthy I promise. I just happen to be blessed with ‚Äúfortune cookie wisdom.‚Äù"
"When I first started the program three months ago, I was at the lowest point in my life. Depressed, feeling hopeless and ready to give up. When I first started taking the classes, I didn‚Äôt pay much attention. But a month later, I decided to commit and to accept and absorb the information given to me. I had to forget everything I thought I knew before. Learning, practicing and patiently waiting for that ‚ÄúAHA‚Äù moment they always talked about. I was doubtful, but I kept going believing I could do it. Less than a month ago it happened, what they had been talking about from day one, that instant spark in which changed my life forever. Because of this program I will never be the same. I wish I could have told my suicidal self months ago that it was going to be alright and work out. The transition was not only noticed by myself but those around me. I became living proof of the very thing I once doubted; that openness, non-judgement, and lots of patients could transform a weeping soul into a newly sprouting flower. I encourage anyone, who feels as if they have nothing to give or hopeless of changing your bad habits, to take this course. Theres nothing else like it and I'm grateful for it appearing in my life and restoring all of which was lost.

"Centered Recovery has empowered me to live my life free of alchol. After more than 20years of unsuccessful attempts at sobriety, I have finally found what works for me . Through the classes at Centered Recovery and their acceptional staff, Reid , Mayer and my therapist Lauren. I have become aware that everything I need is inside of me. This outlook changed the way that I view th world and the amazing people in it. Accepting life as it is and being fully aware of my surroundings has led me to the path of overcoming my addictions. I am so grateful to the wonderful people I met at centered recovery. I wish that anyone still suffering from addiction take this path. It will change your life forever."
"After having been in many recovery programs and not feeling a significant  change that kept me sober, I learned of Centered Recovery. I moved here for this program unsure, but with high hopes. I couldn't be happier with what I've learned, words cannot explain the freedom and control I now feel. Centered recovery changed my life in more that just freeing my addiction, It opened up a world and way of thinking that allowed my full potential. If you want to get sober, stay sober, and find your true self,  this is the place to learn how. i will be forever grateful for all I've learned here from such amazing people!!!!"
"Personally, I have had the pleasure of experiencing Reed and Kristas' program.  It opened my eyes to the root problem of my addiction. Not only have I remained sober, but now I am now living a life free of fear, stress, anger, resentment, anxiety, depression or regret!! I can't even explain into words how truly greatful I am to have had this wonderful family come into my life!"
"centered recovery has become a safe place for me to relax and sureound myself with like-minded people who are free of judgement. aside from helping with cravings and urges, my entire mood and self-imflection has changed since joining the program. their daily mindful skills has helped me shift into a way of life where i‚Äôm no longer caught in an endless cycle of stress and depression. program director reed made me feel accepted and understood after my first phone call and helped me out finacially as i am only 20 and doing this by myself. 12 steps wasn‚Äôt for me and i have found so much peace and joy within myself
thanks to centered recovery. definetly worth checking out. :)"
"I first encountered Reed Smith and this program and philosophy on leading a life free from fear in... as they say in the world of treatment centers, ""not on a winning streak"".  After several years of finding myself getting in my own way towards a life of success and happiness, I found I was instead letting alcohol (in Herculean amounts) overtake me.  Or perhaps it was visa versa?  Either way...  ;-)

I first called up Reed, quite-drunk, in desperately begging him/his treatment center to ""Please FIX me!"".  I had convinced myself (as had many others) that it was ALCOHOL that was the Alpha and the Omega, the root and trunk and branches of ALL of my problems.  Reed, patiently and without judgement, said ""what's there to fix?"".  Now, even had I been as sober as a priest on Sunday at the time, that reply from a treatment center counselor would have perplexed me.  Drunk as I was at that moment, it downright frustrated the heck out of me.  ""I'm a drunk!  I can't stop drinking!  I'm struggling with my work, my life, my relationships, and my health-  Of COURSE I am broken, you jerk!"" is (pretty close to) what I replied to this oddly calm person who was absolutely unlike ANY other person at the various centers, rehabs, in and outpatient treatment centers I had spoken to that day.  He basically repeated the same thing, ask me a few questions, and at the end, voiced out-loud what I myself had been thinking inside already throughout my conversation.  ""Dude- I like the cut of your jib.  We'd love to have you come down here and learn a better way, my friend.""

Still floored, I agreed to take a flier on learning a better way going through and looking at life.

Through my program in my time working with Reed and others learning the concepts of Mindfulness, Heath Realization, and the Three Principals, I learned (in spite of all my attempts to resist, ha!) that I was, indeed, NEVER broken.  That there was not, nor could there ever have been, anything to break.  I learned to recognize that it was, in the end, me (and not work, or 'that jerk in the other car on the freeway', or my wife/boss/parents/etc) that was inventing problems that simply did not exist, and that it was me that was telling my brain that alcohol- this odd thing that was outside of myself- was somehow the solution. Looking back, and even typing this now, I realize just how NUTS that is!  Haha!

Since coming to these (and so, so many more) understandings while working with Reed and others in the areas of Centered, Mindfulness-based recover, I-  have come to a point in my life where I am at peace, sober, joyful, and fulfilled.  This peace and understanding has caused innumerable positive life-changes (how could it not?).  While I could list here a dozen tangible things like the promotions, home, relationships (romantic and otherwise), and material improvements I have seen, I won't.  Instead, I will state the ones that really matter:

I love myself.
I love others, and far more than ever before.
I live in a state of gratitude and peace.
I see the good rather than the bad in others.

Take a chance on Centered Recovery.  You've come this far.  Trust your intuition, and give them a call. Find peace.  :-)"






"They are the Chick-Fil-a of Physical Therapy!
Professional, friendly staff!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!!"
"I had an injury in my neck and suffered for about 10 years in pain and lived a miserable life as a result.. until I met Julianne Popivchak at Benchmark in Buford, GA. This young lady has magical hands and gave me my life back with her touch and dry needles while doctors couldn‚Äôt help me ever. I can‚Äôt thank her enough."
"Benchmark Therapy is amazing!! All the therapists are very nice, especially Julieanneü•∞. She has helped me so much with my back and knee pain, she is so patient and very thorough. I would highly recommend this physical therapy group!!!"
"The best staff providing the best care possible. In 6 months, I went from walking on crutches to being able to run on a treadmill. I cannot thank them enough."
"I came to Benchmark to receive PT for a torn medial meniscus.  My therapist was Julie, and she's awesome!  When I first started, I was very concerned about whether I'd be able to resume my daily household activities, much less return to my normal workout routine of crossfit-type workouts.  Julie was extremely encouraging and positive, which really put me at ease and gave me hope for a full recovery.  The exercises she gave me to do at home each week were quickly effective, allowing me to see consistent improvement.  Julie was a great listener and observer, and then she was very good at adapting my treatment to meet my changing needs.  Throughout my treatment, I told her specific movements and exercises I wanted to be able to get back to, and she helped me achieve those goals safely and with confidence.  This motivated me to keep setting new goals without fear of my limitations.  I'm extremely grateful for not only the physical progress, but also the mental shift from hesitation and worry (about my injury) to optimism and hope.  Thank you, Julie!!!"
"Julie, Laura, and Erika provided the highest degree of care and compassion while I was recovering from a foot surgery. They always went the extra mile to make sure I was well taken care of physically, and they always gave me the encouragement, tools, and support I needed to stay on track with my goals and work toward a full recovery. I would highly recommend this Benchmark location to anyone in need of physical therapy services. I am so thankful for all my Benchmark team has done for me!"
I love the staff David Leah and Ashly. They are best team in GA very friendly Smily and listen to one's concern. They are very caring and easy to talk.I go there twice a week it's best experience
Great Team!


"I got the best care possible at Benchmark. They always worked around my schedule and Joe my physical therapist was always one step ahead of my doctors, he always knew what I needed to do to get better and back on my feet. I can't thank them enough for all they have done for me!"
BenchMark Physical Therapy (West Forsyth) are the BEST! - I was having a difficult time recovering from extensive back surgery - My surgeon recommended them and I am glad he did... the staff and Physical Therapist there are great caring people who work with you and adapt their exercises to your specific surgery and needs. Even if you have not had surgery but need help they are there for you --- HIGHLY RECOMMEND this group!
Joseph Serilio did an excellent job getting me back to my regular activities. The staff there was great as well! It was always a good day to cut up with the ladies there!
Everyone at benchmark was just great! Have used them on two separate occasions  and just love it there. Thanks  to all of them.
"This has been a review long overdue. I was here for a herniated disc. I walked in with a level 10 pain. When I was walking out , they made sure I was equipped enough to handle the pain. Over time , the exercises helped me not only manage pain, now I am pain free ! The positivity in the place is remarkable. The therapists definitely know what they are doing. . Thanks to Cody, and Haley and the amazing rest of the team. I always felt welcomed , and relieved ."
"I cannot say enough good things about Benchmark and my Physical Therapist, Natalie Espinoza-Hensley. I spent six weeks at this location, going 2x per week. The facility is well run, friendly and organized. Thank you Natalie for helping me accelerate my knee replacement recovery. Job well done."
BenchMark was a great experience. I had knee surgery and wanted to get back to work as quickly as possible. The staff is amazing and they are there every step to help you achieve your goals! I worked with Natalie and she was awesome. She helped me progress through my goals and got me back to work. I even had a point where I was down and thought I would not hit my goal. Natalie helped me refocus and realize I could still hit my goal. You guys are the best and thank you for a wonderful experience. Would definitely recommend to friends and family for a 5 star experience.
"I had the pleasure of working with Natalie who was knowledgeable, understood my situation and taught me through the physical therapy techniques how to resolve my issues.  There was an inviting sense of commaraderie among the staff and patients.  I would happily return for PT should the need arise."
I just completed my PT with Haley at Benchmark. She was amazing! The other staff was super friendly too! I was so sad to leave because they are so friendly they truly become your friends. I loved the work she showed me and it‚Äôs easy to continue most of it at home as well now that I‚Äôm done if I feel the need to. I‚Äôd definitely recommend them.
"I attended Benchmark due to knee surgery.  The professional staff developed a plan for me to follow at the facility and some easy things to do at home.  They challenge you to do your best since only you can do the work.  They had me work on different exercises so boredom did not set in.  When my rehab was done, I was able to ‚Äúwalk‚Äù out being much improved and knowing I need to continue being active to help heal completely.  I appreciate my time there and the time the therapists took with me."
"I love this place! They are like family! Cody is a great Physical Therapist. My assign Therapist even tho she is new she has been most helpful and understanding. ‚ÄúMisha‚Äù Webber, you are awesome at what you are doing and you have all that you will ever need to be the best PT in any clinic you decide to stay or go to. I‚Äôve been to a few pt places in my in my long rehab road and this one is by far the best I‚Äôve ever been to. I feel like I am with family and they will push you till you get where you want to be. Thank you Pts
Haley, Jess, Natalie, Destiny, Hannah, And Amanda! Y‚Äôall make Pt enjoyable."
Haley and the other physical therapist make a great team.  They work well together by helping the patients do their exercises.  Haley asked me what my goals were and gave me exercises to make my knee stronger.  I still have a dull aching pain but I can keep doing the exercises at home.  I highly recommend BenchMark Physical Therapy.
"Highly recommend!!
The environment is very relaxed and that makes it very comfortable to go and get your therapy. I have had nothing short of an excellent experience. They really care about you and want to help you get better."
"The therapy received at this location was a great blessing.  I've learned a lot about taking care of myself in the future.
I'm a hiker and they designed the solution around that."
"When my doctor recommended physical therapy, I wasn't looking forward to going.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with my experience at Benchmark West Forsyth.  The therapy was so beneficial and I felt better very quickly.  The folks at Benchmark didn't just focus on my current recovery, they provided advice on lifestyle and activity changes that would help me avoid having to come back again.  Great place and a great experience!"
"I am extremely happy with the Physical Therapy treatment I had at the West Forsyth BenchMark facility. The whole team were great -- professional, friendly, knowledgeable and effective. My hip pain is resolved and I am committed to continuing home exercises to maintain my better condition. I want to give a special shout-out to Jessica, my assigned therapist. Her cheerful encouragement and caring expert advice kept me working hard and looking forward to continued improvement. She rocks!"
Awesome team and experience. Thank you for everything!
"I have seen the therapists at Benchmark West Forsyth for several different injuries as have several members of my family.  When you walk in and are greeted by Amanda and Jenna's smiling faces you know you will be well taken care of.  Destiny, James, Hailey, Kyle, and Nina are all incredible at getting you to your goal safely while having fun.  I would recommend this practice to anyone."
I have been going here for a month for lymphedema therapy which resulted from radiation and surgery. Love Haley and the whole team here they are professional and friendly and play great music! üíïüíï
"Benchmark West Forsyth definitely exceeded my expectations for my 15 year old daughter‚Äôs patella realignment therapy.  Our consult appointment with Haley was exceptional as we discussed recovery goals and expectations and timeline to achieve.  As a parent I was very comfortable with the degree in which the therapists accelerated the treatment each week to obtain full recovery.   In addition the therapists at Benchmark are very creative,  crazy fun and very easy to talk to.  My daughter didn‚Äôt want to stop being a patient here !!"
"I had one visit with Benchmark for my shoulder, it became evident immediately that the young man who was assigned to me had no experience at all and was not qualified to do some of the treatments that I needed.  I decided at that point that I should go find a professional company for my treatment. I also kept getting bills from them that I did not owe. It has been so much trouble trying to get this resolved. I wish I had never gone there in the first place."
While physical therapy is not fun I enjoy working with the staff to get my knee stronger with flexability.
I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better group of people to have to see 2-3 times a week for 6 months. The team at Benchmark worked with me and really listened to how I was feeling and answered all my questions. They pushed me to do my best and always knew how to put a smile on my face and keep me positive. I will definitely recommend them to anyone in the area looking for a physical therapist
"Really professional, down to earth, knows all the techniques just tailor made for you. Staff really professional. Really kind people, still they know thier work. Highly recommended.

Update July 26, 2016: Nothing has changed in this office, everyone is friendly , doesn't feel like I am going for therapy, seems that i am going to meet some friends. They always come up with new and innovative ways to suit my therapy needs. I am a flight attendant and I need to pull/ push heavy beverage carts, so to simulate pushing a beverage cart they got a shopping cart tie it down with row weight machine on the bottom, put some weights in it, and walla I was pushing same weight as beverage cart, really the best therapy experience I have had till now."
"Perfect blend of comfortable setting with dedicated physical therapists that care.  The entire team was always professional, welcoming and focused on my goals.  After being formally released, I signed up for ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù, so I can continue my work with this team."
my favorite part about the whole experience was walking through the doors and being greeted with 14 different hellos!
"The entire team at West Forsyth is phenomenal! Everyone is extremely knowledgeable,  professional and make having PT fun! I can't say enough amazing things about them. Thank you for all you do!"
"My PT experience at BenchMark West Forsyth has been awesome!  From arriving at the front desk with welcoming smiles until the end of treatment with Dr. James, I could not have asked for better service and results.  I was treated with needling for achilles tendinitis.  The doctors there have a variety of treatment plans and are certified specialists in many different areas.  I highly recommend this location and know you will not be disappointed."
These guy's  are great! Made me feel comfortable and at ease. I would recommend this place to family and friends.ü§ó
"Destiny and team are ABSOLUTELY amazing!  They kick my butt every time that I come in there, but all for my benefit.  My foot is healing slowly but surely after a recent surgery."
Good friendly people. They know their stuff. I have a spinal condition that they have helped me with. They even offered me an affordable rate to continue using their gym after my insurance cut me off.
They really helped me through the process of physically and emotionally recovering! Great group of people. Highly skilled! :)
"Casual office atmosphere, friendly, down to business. I didn't know what to expect from needling therapy, but by the 2nd treatment it was clear that it was powerful at relieving accumulated tension and inflammation in the targeted muscle. Then I learned that 'real' exercise is simple and a little challenging, but never 'hard' or painful. Robert came up with thoughtful adjustments to the basic movements to allow me to make further progress on my own in supporting the lower back for spinal stenosis. Now I know that I don't need expensive equipment or a trainer to stay 'fit enough' for my life needs. That's what I call a 'complete' answer. Loved the staff and will kind of miss my PT sessions!"
Not happy and would not return!!!
Therapists are great!
Frustrated....period.
"(Translated by Google) I am very happy excellent work I am grateful

Estoy muy contento excelente trabajo me siento agradecido"

"Great location. Haley was very helpful in getting me all registered and understand insurance coverage. Kristie also very helpful in checking in and scheduling. Started out with Mark and finished up with Grey. Both are very knowledgeable and professional. Gabby, Erin, and everyone else who helped along the way. Thank you all for getting me back to doing everyday activities without pain!"
Benchmark physical therapy in Grovetown is the best. Giving thanks to Austin and Wesley for helping me and thanks to the staff warm and friendly environment there is no other places I would go for physical therapy only Benchmark . They are number one.
I cant say I enjoyed it but they were very helpful in getting me walking after my knee replacement. Annalise was very patient with me. She worked me at a slower pace since I had a bad experience at another PT before coming here. If I ever need PT again I will be sure to go to Benchmark Grovetown office.  Thanks Annalise for being so good with me
"My experience with BenchMark-Grovetown was great!  The office staff (Haley and Kristie) were helpful and friendly, and Stu is the best therapist in the business. Everyone there did a great job helping me recover and get stronger. Great job by everyone!! Thanks!"
I would like to thank Christine and Haley for making my in -process  pleasant and easy also to my therapist  Annalise for helping me feel much better and to challenge myself more each day. They‚Äôre all very friendly.  I highly recommend!!!
"I had nothing but a great experience.  It is easy to see that the entire staff are there for one thing and that is to help in the healing process.  Dr. Grey, Aaron, and Joy, I cannot thank you enough."
Grey is the best! Went from not being able to walk to walking in 11 weeks after having surgery on my foot.
BenchMark in Grovetown is an amazing place to receive therapy.  Everyone is so very kind and helpful.  Nathalie was my therapist and she is excellent.  She taught me ways to reduce my level of pain.   Her knowledge of her field is impressive and that along with her caring personality makes her an awesome therapist.  I am so glad I was able to have my therapy at BenchMark in Grovetown.
I would like to thank Kristie and Grey with such a wonderful experience. Friendly and knowledgeable.
Mrs.Christy is very helpful to schedule appointments that best benefit your needs.
Was very impressed with Benchmark. Christie always friendly. My pt Stu was extremely knowledgeable regarding my injury..I appreciated that very much. A great place to recover.
Absolutely love this place. After just three visits with Grey my 9 y/o daughter could tell a huge difference in the tightness of her muscles; can't wait to see the difference in her with her last visit. I highly recommend this place. A huge bonus is Kristie at the front desk is amazing.
My husband and I have been coming to benchmark physical therapy and we are so pleased with the physical therapists particularly Analise and Grey for their great work! Everyone there is so very kind and thoughtful and they strive to help you be the best you can be! I strongly recommend them.
"I had two wonderful PTs to get me through my therepy. Stew and Savannah were great!  I enjoyed working with them. They helped, encouraged, and motivated me push through.  If I ever need therapy again, I'm looking them upüòä.

The facility was always clean. I noticed that all the PTs seam to work as a team. If one was busy,  one of the other ones would clean equipment, change/wash pillowcases, etc. after each use. It makes a BIG difference when you have teamwork!

Thanks for everything, keep up the good work and stay safe! THANKS AGAIN STEW AND SAVANNAH!!!"
"BenchMark Physical Therapy in Grovetown is the best. The staff makes you feel like family. They treat all clients with the utmost caring and understanding. Grey and his staff are outstanding. Shout outs to Grey, Kate and Alex."
"If you can call going to physical therapy fun, then I thoroughly enjoyed my experience! The staff was friendly and helpful and the therapist were engaging and made the sessions fun. If I ever need physical therapy again, I will definitely be using Benchmark again."
Very nice place. All of the staff is very friendly and accommodating. I would recommend it to anyone.
The staff are so helpful and accommodating.  They helped us with some insurance issues and just an overall pleasant experience.  I‚Äôm also confident of the therapy I‚Äôm receiving to get me well again!
This place is super clean and the staff is absolutely amazing. Christy and Annalise were always so helpful here at this location. They take there time to understand your needs to ensure you get the best results!!!
"I cannot say enough about Benchmark Physical Therapy and the therapist I worked with, Grey Haddon. Grey got me through the third trimester of a twin pregnancy. I was having excruciating pain in my back/shoulder/neck that made it unable for me to continue working. I had even made a trip to the ER for the pain and saw a sports medicine/Ortho doctor without relief. Grey was able to decrease my pain significantly on day 1. He gave me hope when I thought I was doomed to live in pain until delivery. Seeing Grey every week was my only form of relief and it kept my pain level manageable. By the end of my treatment I was virtually pain free. My pain went from an unbearable 10/10 to 1/10. Grey is an angel and his team was amazing! Highly suggest!!"
"Great place with very knowledgable staff. Gray is the best, ask for him. Thank you guys so much 100 stars!"
The staff at this benchmark is amazing they are very helpful and go out of their way to make sure you get fully healed and back to your regular daily life without any pain or discomfort
We love Benchmark Grovetown!! Everyone is so nice from Kristy at the front desk to Trey and Samantha the therapist they are always looking out for the best interest of my daughters therapy. Thank you for making therapy easy to deal with.
"I was super impressed with this place. After going to the VA for physical therapy a couple years back, I felt like therapy was a joke. The VA had me in with about 20 other people and it felt like I was in a gym with a couple people walking around giving exercise orders. But this was much different and it changed my mind about PT. Grey Haddon (my therapist) was extremely knowledgeable and took tons of time to explain to me his knowledge and tell me what was causing my pain and how he plans to make it better. I left feeling amazing and had a new perspective on what physical therapy can do for me.

I also want to mention that I almost left. My insurance won‚Äôt cover this and my out of pocket was going to be very high until my deductible was met. The staff was patient with me even when it was obvious I was getting frustrated, and they walked me through alternative options that were available. I appreciate a company who understands my frustrations and doesn‚Äôt suddenly get annoyed that I‚Äôm becoming stressed over the situation. They were very professional at all times and I will definitely recommend the Grovetown Benchmark to anyone I know who needs help with their pain."
"Awesome, professional staff! Amazing treatment, friendly and knowledgeable in treatments. Thank you for such a great experience!"
"Fun, encouraging, nurturing environment.  Knowledge therapist. Highly recommend."




"Getting me back to ‚Äúme‚Äù after surgery takes work. So glad I have the physical therapists at BenchMark to help me. Libby & Sam REALLY know what they‚Äôre doing and have made the 4 weeks I‚Äôve been coming here productive and fun. Between the stretches and exercises they‚Äôve taught me to help my SI Joint/back & to help strengthen my core along with the Dry Needling and Cupping, it has been a most enjoyable & beneficial journey so far. Never really believed in PT until now but BenchMark, Libby & Sam have made me a true believer! So thankful & grateful for them! ü•∞üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"For Genuine concern and Excellent Professional care, you can count on every staff member at BENCHMARK to ensure you reach or exceed maximum recovery. It has truly been heartwarming to have staff to show they really care about you personally. I wish I had come here from the start.  Thank you so much for all that you do Libby, Sam,  Sydney.... EVERYONE! Sincerely & Wholeheartedly,  Sonya Harris"
"EVERY visit from Day 1 has been impressive! From the Front Desk Staff to EACH Therapist and Assistant.

This is the FIRST time that I've felt like they are genuinely concerned about MY progress... and really helping me to get better... Unlike other places who simply try to rush patients out the door...

I HIGHLY Recommend Benchmark Powder Springs! Because I finally feel like someone really cares... and the Level of Expertise is simply Remarkable.

Thanks Soooo much to Libby, Sam, David, Sydney... and All that continue to play a roll in ensuring I'm up & running again!

Love y'all!
Sincerely & Wholeheartedly,
SONYA HARRIS"
"The entire staff is very friendly, non-judgmental and very supportive.  My PT Libby showed me stretching techniques that helps alleviate pressure in my lower back. She is fabulous!!!"
I did not know what to think or expect with starting physical therapy. The team here has has made my experience very smooth during an uncomfortable situation. I won't go anywhere else for PT needs now they allow you to truly feel welcome and comfortable during this process.
"Amazing experience. Olivia and her team exceeded my expectations. As a runner, I‚Äôve suffered with plantar fasciitis for 8 years. I‚Äôm now on my way to recovery and running again. All of the exercises have been useful, easy, efficient, and effective."
The staff here is Amazing!! They really care about you and what they are doing. I highly recommend this location.
The staff here is amazing they‚Äôre very respectful they‚Äôre funny they‚Äôre helpful they are understanding I had knee surgery my ACL and my meniscus repaired and they‚Äôve been nothing but patient and understanding with me I would recommend benchmark to anyone
The staff is always friendly and welcoming and real progress is felt in every session.
Since 2019 ive been coming too benchmark an they have been just outstanding grade A in my book for sure
Everyone is great and I am grateful for all the help I‚Äôm getting.
"Powder Springs is hands down, the best clinic ever!"
Great team!
"I found the staff to be knowledgeable, friendly, and properly challenging when I had to recuperate from a knee injury. What I had assumed would be a scary, dehumanizing process was instead a welcoming environment that put me back on the road to walking like I had never had the injury."
Excellent staff highly recommended for Physical Therapy simply the best.



Pc solutions is great at what they do all the staff is so friendly ..My 12 yr old daughters does therapy here and she loves everyone there.. They‚Äôre amazing and she is making great progress here.
"These folks have it all great people great attitude. Warm family feel, I've been through one knee replacement and about to do another. Cannot think of another group I'd use,  they are awesome!"
"PT Solutions North has a knowledgeable, caring staff in a convenient location. The staff here are always welcoming, flexible,  interested in how I‚Äôm feeling and works to find the best exercises for my hand/wrist. I have watched how the staff interacts with others patients always with respect and concern. I highly recommend Anna and the other staff for any physical therapy needs."
Awesome people!! They made my day seem so much better. Gave me strength to push forward and to reach my goal. Would recommend them to anyone needing physical therapy.
"I knew PT Solutions was the right fit for me after my initial visit. My therapist, Nicole, explained to me exactly what she needed for me to do to get me back on the right track. Thank you PT Solutions!"
This is a great team of caring professionals.  Everyone I have worked with from the folks who answer the phone to my therapist has made every effort to assist in my treatment.  They have the best Telemed system we have worked with to date.  It just works and any little problems are addressed promptly.
Honestly I am not able to sY enough about the great staff and courteous atmosphere that I feel while I am there. Everyone at PT Solutions in Cartersville are just what you need to feel welcome and cared for. Keep up the great work.
"I have been using PT Solutions for over 7 years and have never had a bad experience!  They are professional, courteous  and skillful in the application of physical therapy. At one point I could not walk 1 mile and now I have completed a bicycle ride across the United States.  They have worked on my back, elbow, neck and most recently my shoulder.  My shoulder surgery was extensive and I am quickly on the road to a full recovery.  Simply put:  PT Solutions gave me my life back!  Thanks for everything Dale and team!!!!"
I am so thankful to have been sent to PT Solutions for my PT therapy as they are wonderful.  I was in such pain and my therapy was centered around the pain.  Each time I came in for therapy my pain level is becoming less each time.  I am also learning that I should be more active so that these muscles get more of a work out and put to good use.  I was given a sheet that had exercises for me to do at home and I have been doing them and they helped a great deal.
If you need therapy this is the place to go. The therapist are so friendly and so knowledgeable.
I was referred by my doctor to PT Solutions at Harbin Clinic for therapy on my shoulder. The team there has a great cohesion with the patients. Someone is always telling a joke or something funny to help make your one hour session a little more enjoyable.
"Alex has been super to work with, very helpful after just a few sessions!
The reminders for appointments are good, and the staff are all friendly and kind."
Everyone in the office is fantastic. You are greeted with smiles and by name as soon as you walk in. Each of the therapists takes the time to listen to your concerns and answer questions in detail.
"Excellent staff. Friendly, knowledgeable, and very skilled at their craft."
"PT Solutions is an excellent practice.  They are professional, friendly, and efficient.  I like the fact that they all work together to provide each patient with more than adequate attention to their individual therapeutic needs.
I would highly recommend them for anyone needing physical therapy."
"I was welcomed the minute I walked in.  I was always with someone to take care of me, never ignored or never left waiting."
This place is wonderful. First visit was today and my physical therapist was very helpful and friendly. Could tell exactly what was wrong and did her best to help! Looking forward to next week!
"All of the people I encounter at PT Solutions from the front desk, the manager, the assistants and the therapist are very polite , personal
and professional. I had a shoulder replacement which requires a lot of therapy but it is not with dread that
I go because PT Solutions has a very friendly helpful atmosphere . You are called by name and treated as family.
I have to have my other shoulder replaced after I complete therapy and will not even thinking about going elsewhere for therapy for it. Thank you to the staff at PT Solutions for the physical and emotional suport you have given without even knowing it."
They have a wonderful group of professionals who know just how to prescribe the right program for YOU and individually care about you.
I have had great results from my Physical Therapy visits to PT Solutions.  Everyone is courteous and professional.  I would definitely recommend this company.
"Great people,they are very attentive to patients needs and try very hard to help them meet their goals."
"Very nice and  caring group of people . Would
Highly  recommend them!"
Excellent Staff & Facility.
Friendly professional staff.
PT Solutions personnel are very informative and competent.
Great team !!!
Great staff

















"Benchmark PT on Highland Avenue provided a supportive, positive and COVID-safe environment for my extended PT recovery after surgery for a broken ankle. The physical therapists are skilled with many helpful tools and techniques. The best part about the team here is their friendly and supportive environment. They offer encouragement all along the way. I am so happy with my PT experience here!"
"Add me to the list of glowing reviews for the BenchMark Virginia-Highlands team.  Erika did a fabulous job helping to address my neck pain issues and Poonam has been great with my teenage son, who injured his back diving.  Celeste makes all of the billing, paperwork and scheduling a breeze.  They even have great trivia questions!"
I could not have been more pleased with Erika and the staff at the Virginia Highlands locations.  The exercise program was perfect for rebuilding the muscles needed to support my knee after surgery.   I progressed quickly and now have full mobility as a result of the great care I received.
Super friendly as well as helpful. After having a bad ankle sprain poonam helped me to achieve all of my goals and get back to doing the things I was doing before.
"Absolutely awesome! I went to urgent care and found that I had strained my neck/trap region extremely badly, and the doctor recommended dry needling at BenchMark.

They were able to see me on the same day, and the quality of care was amazing. Everyone was extremely helpful, kind, and knowledgeable. I felt completely at ease, and the clinic director, Poonam, saw me herself.

A couple visits later, and I'm recovered! Can't recommend Benchmark on North Highland enough."


"Best care always. Fourth experience using Benchmark. All have been great. Friendly staff, Michael is caring, and Baylee gives awesome care plus delightful to work with. GREAT group - will come again!  Massaging my thumb was a perfect end to my hour. üòåüòäüòç"
"Acworth Benchmark has an amazing staff‚Äù friendly and professional ‚Ä¶my Occupational Therapist, Ms Bailey is awesome!!!
She‚Äôs thorough, patient and very knowledgeable in her field she has done an amazing job on my wrist. I love that she really take her time with each of her patients and she make sure you understand what‚Äôs going on and why, with a smile‚Ä¶"
"The front desk staff were always inviting and friendly during visits.  The technicians that assisted the therapists were encouraging and engaging in their interactions during the exercises.  I worked with the therapists Michael, Montana and Renee during my treatment.  They each offered their unique perspective and education on how to manage the pain and the recovery process.   I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more supportive team.  Prayerfully I will not have need for therapy again but know exactly who I will call and highly recommend this Benchmark Acworth team.  They earned these five stars."
"Very friendly atmosphere. Montana is awesome! She knows her stuff! The whole staff works well together and jumps in to help each other when needed. Montana did a great job getting my shoulder back in motion! Second time going to her, she worked on my other shoulder a few years back. I would highly recommend Benchmark!"
"Outstanding team for service and physical therapy.  From the front desk team capably handling insurance matters, to the technicians assisting the therapists, to the expert PTs and OTs - this is a special place for treatment and healing.  I am so grateful to Montana Anderson for handling my case and her excellent therapy care.

I highly recommend this Acworth facility if you are looking for quality professional PT or OT.  It is well managed with a kind and courteous staff."
Bailey was extremely helpful and I would recommend her to anyone needing OT for their hand.
"Was having a lot of back pain and doctor prescribed physical therapy.  Ashley at Benchmark was wonderful.
My back feels so much better.  Thanks Ashley üòä for your help."
"Absolutely love Benchmark Physical Therapy. Place is close to my home. My physical therapist Kaitlyn Coddington is amazing. Takes time to go over everything that you have to say before working with you while working with you and after working with you. Takes into acount even the smallest things. Helps with filing out paper work if having difficulty answering quetions. Generally just an amazing person.
The staff is also amazing great with helping to fill out and provide paperwork and answering quetions. The environment is very comfortable to be at."
The entire staff are very friendly and yet professional at the same time. Highly recommend!
"My shoulder is now well on it's way to full recovery!  Thanks, Benchmark/Michael!!"
Personal and caring made my recovery so much easier.  What a support team!!
7 AM appointment with a no show from the therapist.  The staff arrived 5 minutes before opening.
The pt people are great.
Great and Friendly Service!
"I work at Emory so I feel really bad in writing this review but I had to inform other of the unprofessional behavior at this location. I scheduled a PT (Achilles) appointment that my doc at the same location (Emory Johns Creek) prescribed. During the scheduling, I asked them about my share of payment and I was told that it will be my copay ($25). I went for my appointment and I was charged the copay and was given bunch of forms to sign. After that they mentioned that the therapist I was scheduled with is busy and if I can see another therapist - I accepted.

After the session and a few days later they sent me a bill of $145. I called the office and the billing person (at x2004) said I signed a financial form so I have to pay any additional bill (weird reason). Then she mentioned that the PT had to evaluate the Achilles so there is an evaluation charge of $145. No one ever told me that I was scheduling for a evaluation when my Orthopedics doctor at same location (Emory Johns Creek) is suggesting PT for Achilles. She kept repeating that I signed a financial responsibility form so I have to pay. This is highly unprofessional and unethical; she didn't care about: 1) need for evaluation, 2) need for approval for evaluation or a charge for evaluation, 3) what evaluation was needed/done that insurance refuses to pay (evaluation done was observing me walk).

The therapist was okay (nothing great) - she was seeing 3 patients at the same time and after first 5 mins of spending time with me, she kept sending her assistant/intern to me to inform me of next exercise to complete. I am never returning to this location."
Mike Biller is a true professional. These guys really know what they are doing. My rehab saved my sacrum joint. Do what they say and you will get better.
"My physical therapy was absolutely amazing she have magic hands,  you come in with pain and leave without pain..üëçüëç.. Unfortunately she can have several clients at the same time and this is where the service break happen.. There is a female that help her out feel like she can talk down to you, therefore I just ignore her bad behavior.. I notice the bad behavior with the other female.. I start wearing my head set to block them out.. Today even the front desk was rude. I ask what was my final billl,  like always do, I like to pay there vs getting a bill in the mail .. Her response was thats what I am doing now.. In a nasty tone which she have never done..  Gossiping females.. Really this is not high school regardless of how you feel about a client they should not feel uncomfortable to the point they have to wear head set.. This is not a reflection on Berkeley she is very professional ...  She do her job well and never chatting off to the side like the rest of the female.. Thank God my done ..."
Jenn is amazing! She is compassionate and knowledgeable and helped me find a solution to an issue I have had for almost 30 years. Highly recommend this facility and especially Jenn. She is a superstar!
"I went to Benchmark because I had injured my knee. Jenn worked with me quite diligently,  to relieve my pain and to make my legs stronger.
I believe PT, and Benchmark specifically,  helped me get better. I highly recommend them."
This network of PT was recommended by my doctor after my knee surgery. I was unfamiliar with Benchmark but was fortunate to find an office close to my house (Benchmark Shallowford). I was even more fortunate to have Julia as my therapist. Julia was incredibly knowledgeable and compassionate during my 5 weeks of treatment. She worked diligently to get my strength and range of motion back. I always felt like her most important patient and her friendly kind attitude made the pain she inflicted (just kidding) tolerable! The entire staff is friendly and made me feel at home. Thanks!
"I recently completed rehab for my shoulder at BenchMark PT on Shallowford Road in Marietta. Everyone was polite, professional, caring and extremely helpful throughout my rehab journey. PT Marah was simply fantastic! She provided outstanding support and guidance as my PT progressed these past few months. I can't say enough about how well this facility is managed and operated! Well done all....
Rich J."
"The most amazing clinic and staff!  I have improved from my shoulder surgery significantly and have the staff there to thank. It‚Äôs super clean, the staff is extremely friendly and the exercises are just what I need to improve my mobility. I would highly recommend them above any other clinic. They are all amazing!"
"Following the recommendation of a friend, I came to BenchMark for a shoulder issue. Within a few weeks, I started to notice an improvement. Julia and the entire staff are kind, caring and wonderful to work with. Now, I‚Äôm back to playing the sport that I love, tennis. I would recommend BenchMark Shallowford to any friend or family member."
"Everyone here are so awesome. Very friendly, very helpful, never had a bad day. Going back soon for more therapy. I fully recommend them 100%"
"Fantastic, caring team of professionals who patiently help folks recover and get back to their lives after injury and/or surgeries."
"If you are trying to decide which physical therapy office to pick from, your search is over!  This location of Benchmark is fantastic.  Everyone is very friendly and gracious. I had the good fortune to get Marah as my therapist. She worked on my knee and gave me so many at home exercises to benefit my healing. She was responsive to my comfort level but also knew when to help me stretch myself. The facility is very clean and staff is dedicated to constant cleaning and sanitizing. They enforce proper mask wearing and temperature checks every day. Karesha is the front desk manager and always friendly and willing to help with scheduling, insurance, etc. Nicole was such a good support person for my exercises. Overall, you will love this place. Come here and feel better quickly!!"
"I received excellent care to rehabilitate my broken wrist under the guidance of Jenn.  She listened to my goals and weaknesses to help me heal and be independent.  This facility is professional, clean and considerate.  I am thankful for the personal care and attention from Benchmark Shallowford."
"During the last 4 years ,  I have utilized Benchmark (Shallowford Rd; Highway 92 locations) several times for various PT needs (balance/vertigo, shoulder impingement, trochanter/thigh issue, IT band/twisted knee) .   I totally trust their professional recommendations and treatments!  All of the recommended exercises  were and are of benefits for my needs.  The staff are patient, assertive (just the right amount) and very positive in attitude. and  smiling.  Also, they are good to answer questions.   Exercise instructions are good.  I have finished PT  knowing that my problem was treated and that I could return if necessary. Goals were met...Yes, I continue to do exercises from various  episodes of treatments so not to regress to pre-treatment pain and problems.   I definitely recommend Benchmark!
Much appreciation goes to Tim L, Danielle , Jenn , Marah , Karesha,  and KP (extern).  THANK YOU!  NSM"
"I have been doing rehab for my ACL/PLC  knee reconstructive surgery at Benchmark PT with Julia Buce for approximately 2.5 weeks. During my time here, I have to say this is the best PT center I have ever been treated at! Julia has gone above and beyond with helping me get back on track with my rehab after there was an error in the initial rehab plan sent over by my Physician‚Äôs office. She quickly adjusted the plan and understood my concern with the implications this could have on delaying my return to duty. She took extra time to go over home exercises so that I could make up some time, but she did this in a manner that was very clearly spelled out that safety was the most important element. With this, she took her own time off duty to email me an exercise program with goals and safety limitations to help me with my return to the Army! Her attention to detail and willingness to go the extra mile to help someone out is unmatched!
The entire team at this office  is outstanding! From the minute you walk in the door,  the professionalism and teamwork in this office is clearly evident!. The staff all work together to help each other out and they never make me feel rushed! I highly recommend this center for any  PT you may need!! My sincere Thanks to all of the staff!!"
"I‚Äôve been experiencing back pain for decades and going to a chiropractor for years. Last spring I hurt it in a way that previous practices couldn‚Äôt remedy. I was referred to Benchmark almost as a last resort before major intervention. After four months of physical therapy, I‚Äôm practically new again. I‚Äôd like to thank Julia, Koerisha and Wei for their dedication and professionalism in helping with my recovery. They represent Benchmark and themselves well. I couldn‚Äôt recommend their service more."
"Amazing experience! Staff is pleasant, patient and knowledgeable."
"Dr. Lonergan is very professional, highly intelligent and extremely knowledgeable in his profession.  His ability to locate an injury and create a rehab plan to get you back to full speed is second to none.  It's nice to know there are still Dr.'s out there that will look out for what is best for you as priority number one."
Fantastic experience! The staff knows what they are doing and care deeply about your needs and goals. They were patient and answered all of my questions. I highly recommend this team!
"The staff was very knowledgeable about my lower leg pain.  I was given a comprehensive evaluation as well as an exercise program to assist in getting rid of my pain by addressing the issues that led to the pain in the first place.  I love a place that treats the cause and not just the symptoms.
I will be recommending Dr. Tim Lonergan and this office to those I know."
"Great facility, great service!  Tim Lonergan is one of the Dr.'s of Physical Therapy at this facility and he is awesome!  He was very knowledgeable and you can tell he cares about helping you improve.

If you need physical therapy, you won't be disappointed by choosing this facility!!"
"I couldn't have asked for a better experience.  I went in with some lower back pain.  I expected to be given a couple of exercises and be sent on my way.  Instead, I spent an hour there locating the exact point of pain and then exploring all the muscles that relate to that area to find which ones might could be leading to my issue.  By the time I was done, they had identified the fact that my back was overcompensating for some muscles that weren't pulling their weight (my words not theirs...and pun intended).  I was given a very specific stretching routine to follow but it was only after actually identifying the exact (likely) cause of the issue.  I've left other doctors visits for various ailments with a list of to do's but felt the doctor was guessing.  I've rarely left feeling that the issue I was having had been actually identified and the recommendations were directly related to my specific issues.  I saw Dr Lonergon, but couldn't offer the place a higher recommendation."
Dr. Lonergan was extremely knowledgeable and took a lot of time to make sure he was taking good care of me. Definitely recommend
"I went in to BenchMark for back pain and was treated by Dr. Lonergan. He was very knowledgable and great to work with. The office was clean, staff were friendly, and they got me in right away. I would highly recommend them."


"Excellent experience. The PT, Kyle Hogarth, is very, very competent and in just two visits his work has eliminated severe shoulder pain. I highly recommend this facility to anyone with physical therapy needs. Also, there was no waiting time and there is free parking provided."

I was thoroughly examined, both physically and mentally with detailed questions and procedures that were surely to giv a very vivid report on my current physical abilities ad quality of life.  I really enjoyed my visit and would very much  be more than happy to see them again.
Hat's off to fine crew!!!!!"
I am very pleased to have Kyle Hogarth as my PT. He is giving me great exercises to improve my posture! The receptionist is very pleasant and very helpful in setting up my appointments. Added bonus - free parking! Don't forget to have your ticket validated.
"Christina is warm and caring and encouraging.  Of course, her medical knowledge is extensive, but her way of assisting her clients in their efforts to become whole again are even more wonderful!"

The entire staff made me feel welcome, but Robbie was awesome. I feel like he gave great direction on the exercises I needed to do, what muscle groups I should feel working to the ap, and he was very encouraging throughout the process. Even when he had multiple clients at a time, I still felt as though I got plenty of one on one time with him.

All of the times I‚Äôve been there (which has been a lot) they‚Äôve been super nice and have taken amazing care of me
"I never imagined going to physical therapy for an injury. I never had an injury as a dancer either. This past November, I was in a car crash and the recovery process was close to three months.

With the Lord‚Äôs covering, I lived through the car crash and went to the best physical therapy location in Hiram, Georgia known as PT Solutions. Yesterday, I finally rang the PT Bell to celebrate my VICTORY!!!!

I thank the Lord for the incredible physical therapist who I had throughout my sessions. Katy was my amazing and primary therapist who made me feel at home each time I came and always put a smile and laughter to my face and soul as she cared for me while I was slowly recovering. Also, with physical therapist Bre‚Äôs care and support along the way, it was a joy to see her each time. Lastly, physical therapist Robbie made sure I was aware of the healing process and how tissue and bones connect and heal. Robbie was that amazing therapist who reminds me of a primary doctor that keeps a patient learning about their injury to the recovery process and how to go about living life again.

Wow, PT Solutions was a blessing in so many ways. If anyone needs a place to recover, look no further than PT Solutions in Hiram, GA. It is truly 1st Place choice for service.

Thank you all! God is Good!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèΩüôåüèΩüéâüéäüéâüéâ"

I have told so many that it feels like ‚Äúfamily‚Äù there.  Everyone is so very friendly, sweet, and caring. They are all dedicated to helping you achieve your goal to get better!  The culture and climate of any establishment begins at the top and trickles down.  The minute you walk in the door you are greeted by the sweetest office staff ever.  The therapist (Erin, Dylan, and Katie) have been so very good to me.  (I am sure the others are great too, but I have only worked with these three).  Bree is on it and ready to help you go from one activity to the next.  Not only is the staff amazing, but they set the tone for warm and caring environment where the patients also cheer each other on.  I have truly enjoyed my experience there and will miss them all when my time is over!"

I have been going to this location after having surgery on my lower back. The friendly staff has helped me return back to normal life in a short amount of time. Front desk is very helpful and always has appointment times available for my schedule. Therapists answer any questions you might have and help you achieve whatever recovery goals you have. I highly recommend this location.
The staff here is really nice and they all know what they are doing so you can come in anytime and have a good session.
I was here for around 4 months with an ankle injury and the staff is absolutely amazing!

This is not only my First time coming here, but my second! After my second spinal surgery i insisted that I come back to the place which made me feel whole once and i would not go anywhere else!  The workouts are good and the therapists are even better! Coming here will not be a regret but only a blessing."
"these people are amazing, they helped me through my first injury and now helping me get through my second. this should be the place you go for physical therapy."
I throughly enjoyed my time at PT Solutions. With being an athlete they have helped me through two ACL surgeries and many other minor injuries. They encouraged me when I had no faith in myself and my abilities. I can always count on a friendly smile and for them to help me push myself every visit at PT Solutions. They helped me become a better person and athlete and I could never thank them for helping. me return to the sport I love.
"I am welcomed as soon as I get there. Front desk staff are kind, efficient and accommodating. I am often early, but still the therapists almost always get me started early on my routines.

I have had 4 different PTs work with resolving my joint/muscle pain issues. Each one has been professional, efficient, attentive, concerned, and considerate of my well-being as I complete the exercise routines to help me in my recovery. They are friendly and engaging regarding casual conversations, which help pass the work outs(which can be tough at times) more quickly.

I look forward to seeing them and experiencing the care they have for my well-being."
Erin and Katie are wonderful! They have helped me so much!
"Right when I went there for the first time, everyone was very nice and helpful. Everyone really wanted to help you and they want to get you right back on your feet! Erin is AMAZING! She is a incredible person with a big heart. She never wants to see anyone in pain. She is very encouraging and gives great advice! If you need help she will be more than happy to help you! Whenever I came in stressed or upset they all changed my mood instantly! We would always joke and have a good time but also try to help me get better. I never really believed in the quote ‚Äútime flies when your having fun‚Äù but it is definitely true when you step right into the office! It is a great experience for not just getting help with my injury but also for great advice with my problems! I would definitely recommend it for ANYONE!"

I had a ton of questions, and they all had lots of patience and gave me much insight into my condition and how to best deal with it. Would definitely recommend this to anyone in need of helpful physical therapy!"
"Everyone at PT Solutions has helped me get back into my daily routine. If it weren‚Äôt for them, I probably would still be on crutches and scared to use my right leg. From the minute I walked in on my first day, I was cheerfully greeted and was taken care of immediately. Since then, I have observed and received great customer service and care. I only have a few more sessions left, and I am sad it is almost over. I‚Äôd like to specifically thank Bri for being so positive and helpful. I would highly recommend going to PT Solutions!"

"As a Roswell High School student Athlete....it's very important to keep my body strong and healthy.  I really appreciate Mrs. Shannon for always working around my school,  and training schedule.  If you have any type of injury,  or just need help with recovery methods after games,  and preventing injuries this is the place. You can get PT anywhere,  but Mrs. Shannon and her coworkers are amazing. They understand the importance of athletes getting back out there quickly.  #StudentAthlete @qpartee34"
PT Solutions is the perfect place for all your physical therapy needs. Everyone is so nice and pleasant and the treatment really does help. I am pain free thanks to them!
Have had a great experience at PT solutions on Etris rd. The PT‚Äôs are very knowledgeable and make rehab fun. Shannon is especially fantastic.
"Loved the trainers!!! Always looked forward to PT. I heard from Kelly that for every review Tim will do an exercise. I request that Tim does 6 sets of cone taps. With six cones (three in front, three in back, on one leg) and on the wobbly blue mat. If confused ask Kelly."
"I have had nothing but great experiences from the PT solutions team. Shannon, Tim, Brien, Grace, and Katie are great at what they do and make the ""getting better"" process fun and enjoyable. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and dedicated to finding improvements in your fitness and quality of life.

Picking PT solutions in Roswell was the best decision I've made throughout receiving care. I couldn't imagine a better team to receive treatment for. I cannot recommend this team enough. This team should be at the top of your list of considerations if you are seeking physical therapy."
"My 10 year old daughter loves going to PT Solutions. It‚Äôs a very welcoming, positive and encouraging atmosphere from the moment you walk into the door. Everyone there is knowledgeable, caring, and professional. They make the exercises fun and challenging for my daughter and we have seen a great improvement in a month‚Äôs time."
"Brien, Tim, Shannon and Grace have been so amazing during my journey back to wellness. I can't forget Kate, at the front desk, as well! They have encouraged and cheered me on for the last couple of years. Thanks to them, I'm on my way to walking without a cane! They are so professional and great at what they do!"
Had a great work out with Ms Shannon yesterday 10/10üëçüèæüëçüèæ
"Knowledgeable and caring  therapists with an excellent, holistic approach to improving the health of their clients."
"PT Solutions of Roswell is an excellent facility to foster your rehabilitation! I had a total knee replacement in the summer of 2018 and believe me it was a journey to recovery.  I attribute my success to my therapist Dr.Tim Stark who was thoughtful and creative in defining a  treatment strategy that would work for me.  The staff is courteous, encouraging and professional.  If I ever have the courage to do my other knee I will definitely entrust PT Solutions of Roswell with my post op treatment.  Many Thanks!"
I‚Äôve been going to PT Solutions for several weeks after hip replacement and feeling much better and more flexible every day. The staff are very professional and polite and caring and have really addressed my concerns for more flexibility and have focused the therapy on movement and flexibility. Becca is awesome as are all the staff üëç thank you
"Great atmosphere and therapists. The PT is challenging and it works well. In all of my years of sports injuries, this is the most professional and fun place to go to rehab. I would rate this place as 6 stars if they had a coffee machine for the patients. However since they don't have coffee, refreshments or a smoothie bar, I am subtracting one star and leaving my review at 5 stars."
"Hunter and Megan at the front desk are always so helpful and friendly. The therapists Rachel, Lauren, Rebecca, Shannon, Tim and Taryn are all so wonderful and incredibly knowledgeable. Most importantly, I always have fun with these guys!  You won‚Äôt regret using their services. I feel so much better now!"
"Have received excellent care as a post-sepsis survivor. The PT Solutions treatment regimen restored muscle strength, stamina and endurance. Dr.Timothy Stark set realistic goals that kept me moving toward restoring balance and independence.
I am more than grateful for PT Solutions and their excellent staff."
I was given the most experienced therapist when I arrived.  He walked away while I was doing an exercise and he sent one of the young helpers over to give me directions without the courtesy of letting me know  The young kid had no idea what he was doing. Was not a therapist and kept yawning in my face.  Clearly he was bored and had no interest in his job.  I was very dissatisfied to say the least  This PT solutions had good therapies working there a year ago when my grand children went there.  The therapist they used were no longer working there.
"PT solutions is excellent in every way!  I was in therapy for about two months and had great results.  Elizabeth, Ashley, James, and all the providers there are wonderful people and providers.  I wish all my health care providers were as good as they were.  Thank you for getting me back to my normal pain-free life!  I would highly recommend this location to anyone who needs physical therapy."
My elementary aged son and I have both been treated at PT Solutions Roswell and the staff has become like family! They helped me recover from a car accident with innovative treatment.  My therapists always listen and genuinely care.
The staff is very knowledgable and supportive.   They were able to get my body parts to work much better.  They are highly skilled in their profession.  I can not thank them enough for their help and their attitude.
"Excellent experience compared to other physical therapist I‚Äôve seen in the Roswell/Alpharetta area.
The staff is attentive, competent, respectful and helpful. I‚Äôm so pleased that I went because it has definitely been helpful.
It is easy to get follow up appointments for the same time and days from week to week."
Was pleasantly surprised by the qualifications of the staff. My first visit for knee replacement went well. Staff is attentive and explain all the exercises required and their benefit. Facility is clean and spacious
Very kind and helpful. The place is clean and well kept and well staffed. I would recommend this for most physical therapy
"After an accident, these therapists put me back together.  It actually was a pleasure going to this location 3x a week, while Lindsey & Lauren put me back together.  They were able to work via therapy to quicken my healing on my brain concussion as well as the back, shoulders and neck injuries.  The entire staff is uplifting and every visit was a positive, team experience!"
"If you are having difficulty after an injury or may have pulled something in the gym for instance, the staff at PT Solutions has the knowledge, experience and demeanor to assist you back to health.
Go there and get better!"
"I would highly recommend PT Solutions Roswell to friends and family.   The staff is knowledgable, supportive, and kind.  They have gotten me back on my feet again and appreciate all their support along the way."
Lindsay is wonderful. She is knowledgeable and really makes you feel comfortable. She has helped me so much and I would recommend her to anyone!!
The staff at PT solutions is excellent! Everyone there is very kind and helpful. They take the time to educate me about my injuries and the healing process while helping me get better.
"Fabulous therapists! They listen, and give you appropriate exercise, manual manipulation and I have improved and am almost back to normal, but better!!!!  Thanks to all@"
"The staff is awesome, they are very helpful, and in particular, they have a neuro specialist named Lyndsay, who is a gem. Hunter, the front desk manager, gets an A+ In service, and the atmosphere is welcoming.I strongly recommend this place."
I have taken myself and both of my boys to therapy at the Roswell clinic. Taryn and the other therapists are awesome. Highly Recommended!
"Pre-op I had 5 weeks of PT with another company.
Their services were absolutely lame in comparison with PT Solutions.
The staff really care you get well here, they help each other and there‚Äôs no ‚Äòdowntime‚Äô
Excellent team effort!"
Everyone there is absolutely wonderful. The front desk (Rebecca and hunter) are always so nice and Leigha is amazing and great at what she does!  As for the therapy I can tell a huge difference since I started! I‚Äôm so thankful for everyone there!
Staff is very professional and friendly. I have a therapy program and schedule that I feel is very good for my problem. Scheduling is flexible and easy to make changes.
Very nice facility and friendly staff.  One week in P T and getting great results.
"Have definitely improved in the 2 months i have been going there.  Friendly, engaging staff makes each visit pleasant.  Also nice to have connected store for running shoes, etc."
"Prices are absurd! $400 a visit and they want me to come 3 x a week for a minimum of 12. Therapist Taren was late and had a rude demeanor. The male therapist was great though. Clinic is always busy so you‚Äôll never have the physical therapist by yourself. Overall, would not recommend. Going to PT at another company and am very happy there."
"Great service and care. From the time you walk in the door, Ashley is awesome and all of my therapist have been awesome as well. Certainly a great choice."
These people are miracle workers! I struggled with lower back pain for over a year and today I am pain free!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone!
"Solid crew and amazing knowledge. Will come back, although I hope I don‚Äôt have to."
Friendly and knowledgeable staff.  I have seen real improvement in my condition thanks to this team.
Friendly staff. They have a routine system for most patients. Covers WellStar.
Customer service has gone down since my last visit. Seemed as though they were understaffed. Many improvements can be made.
Incredibly helpful and friendly staff
Excellent care and treatment.













"I am very pleased with the professional, caring service. Morgan and Shelby were exceptionally attentive.  Shelby was amazing. My back is so much better, I can certainly manage the pain without medication so I am extremely grateful for the service. I highly recommend BenckMark in Marrietta."
Very welcoming. The ladies treat me very well. I'm very comfortable and they asked the proper questions to help me out. They were very through and a assertive
"Knowledgeable, Professional, Helpful & Friendly.  Over the last two years I have seen three Physical Therapists at Benchmark - each for a different issue.  All three were excellent and helped me recover so I could continue my active lifestyle.  Many thanks you and all the staff."
I saw Danielle for the past few months and she was amazing. Listened to all of my concerns and taught me new strategies to assist with my care between appointments.  All of the staff is a big family and takes the time to really get to know their clients and make them feel at ease. I highly recommend you visiting.
My therapist Nikki Mathis was amazing. She worked with me to meet all of my goals. She was very patient and thorough. All of the staff at Windy Hill BenchMark were so pleasant and welcoming. I always looked forward to my sessions.
"Thank you so much Nikki Mathis, you have made this nurse of 30 years realize why I got into this profession to begin with. You have been my champion, confidant and friend for the last 2 months and could not even imagine my hand rehab without you being the most important part of it .  You have pushed me to be better and go further with rehab than I could ever admit I would have without you. You are a true inspiration and credit to your profession. I thank you for my family , my insanity and also my patients. As you have retaught me how to be patient , compassionate and caring all over again. You are the best.  Laura"
"This is honestly the best place you could come to get PT the staff is absolutely lovely, I feel amazing after working with Shelby and always getting great reception from Morgan gonna miss this place!"
Love it! The therapist is very professional and his assistants too. Fully recommended.
I had a great experience at this location Danielle is awesome and taught me so much about physical therapy.
"I've worked with Shelby and Danielle over the past few months to fix some chronic upper body pain that's been bothering me the past year and they have been nothing but positive, helpful, insightful, (aggressive on pain when need be) and I finally feel like I'm in a position where I can manage and eventually remove the pain by myself. Huge thanks to Jack, Laura, Simina, and all the other staff that keep this clinic in tip-top shape! :)"
Great atmosphere with welcoming staff. Danielle‚Äôs treatment and treatment plan was so encouraging for remedying my symptoms.
"Nikki Mathis was outstanding! She not only helped me learn and do the exercises that hastened the recovery from my injury, she explained the underlying physical system that caused the discomfort and weakness that was caused by the injury so that I could better deal with ny recovery"
Excellent experience. Never knew how tight the muscles really are until you go to a professional. Thanks so much.
"Referred to Benchmark for a shoulder injury by my Dr and co-workers.  Nothing but good things to say about the program and staff. Erica is my therapist and is super attentive, intuitive, pushes when I need it, and accounts for life in general when building your program. I would be remised not mentioning Danielle, Mina, and Jack too. All professionals who genuinely have your best interests in mind.  Be honest with your therapist, trust the system, and stick to the program."
"I felt very welcomed and taken care of! Shelby was a big help with the pain I was going through with my neck, shoulder, and back! I really appreciate the time and effort that was put into making me feel better!"
Nikki fixed my tennis elbow completely and quickly!  I highly recommend her for OT!
"I have been receiving PT from BenchMark Physical Therapy for about 3 weeks now and it has been amazing!!! This is my first time participating in a physical therapy program and the entire experience has truly exceeded my expectations. Danielle and Janese have been so awesome and they have helped my injury recovery so much. They are so very knowledgeable and anytime I have a question about an injury related symptom, they know exactly what it is and will inform me immediately. Janese is a student and I love how Danielle trains her and at the same time, allows her to step out on her own and work hands on with the patient, Janese is developing extremely well. Overall amazing experience and I look forward to attending every Monday and Wednesday, awesome conversations too!!! Thank you Danielle and Janese!!!"
Nikki is amazing and I definitely recommend her. definitely a five star place with five star service and love the vibez.
Both the PT and the Therapist in training we great! Very knowledgeable and kind
Being here really improve my injury in Nikki Mathis really been doing a good job she's the best ü•∞ü•∞
Every one is professional from the front desk to all the therapists. My therapist Danielle is just the best. Always pushing me to better myself. I love the place.
Nice people seem very caring and listen to you about your needs
"My trainer is Shelby and she is awesome, great place for PT. I‚Äôm glad I was sent here to get better. Comfortable place for anyone who is a little more introvert or not good in social settings, trust you will fit in while being able to learn and heal."
"Benchmark is a small facility packed with qualified professionals that deliver superior treatment. Erica is the best!!!  She challenges me to get better and is as excited as I am when I make process. From day one, she treated me like her number one priority."
"I started OT with Sarah at BenchMark this summer when I had a tennis elbow flare up. She is very knowledgeable, not only about working with my injury, but also my limits and when to push me through an exercise that will make me better. I feel like she is very attentive and is with me the entire time I work through a challenging exercise. The entire BenchMark staff is super personal and greet me by name when I walk in the door. With a mask on, that's impressive. I had some work schedule issues and the staff worked hard together to accommodate me and make sure I did not miss out on my OT. I highly recommend BenchMark! They will get you back up and running in no time :)"
"Very nice, friendly professional staff that assist and support you with obtaining your goals to become healed and healthy again. They work great as a team to make sure that you perform each exercise properly. I proudly wear your logo t-shirt and do not hesitate to recommend you to family, friends and associates. I highly recommend this practice to anyone who has a need for physical therapy. Keep up the great work!"
This place is awesome! Greg is a great physical therapist and the entire staff is super friendly and professional. I was not happy about starting PT but this place changed my mind after only my first visit. Since then I have made so much progress with healing from my injury. Thank you!
Great staff! Been here for multiple injuries. Would definitely come back again but hopefully I don‚Äôt need to.
Erica and the staff are great. Very friendly and listened to each of my concerns. I highly recommend coming here for your physical therapy treatments.
A great team that works to help you reach your goals quickly and safely
Shelby was excellent! She listened to what pain I am having and helped give me exercises that will help me reach my recovery goals. Highly recommend BenchMark Physical Therapy.
I was referred to Benchmark for my neck and arm and had been unable to sleep in my bed and only in a recliner. Receiving services 2 days a week for about 8 weeks the improvement was impressive. Great work and thank you
"The Benchmark team has been great. Erika has been working with me to achieve my goal on my ankle. She‚Äôs very positive, uplifting and great energy . I‚Äôd recommend this place to anyone in need of physical therapy .üôÇ"
Great staff and friendly. They listen to their patients and incorporate different exercises to help for optimal recovery.
Erica is great.  She's very knowledgeable and knows her stuff.  She always had effective methods to target my pain and obtain results.
"Erica is AMAZING!!!! She tailors your therapy not only on your injuries/needs but also according to the what she sees in your posture, the way you move. She really is the ‚ÄúPT Whisperer‚Äù!!! The whole staff is very friendly! I highly recommend this location for your PT needs!!! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
The Benchmark team on Windy Hill is the best! I spent a lot of time here before and after a spinal fusion. The team is so positive and uplifting and really take interest in doing what is best for the patients!
"Today, I started outpatient physical therapy with Erica as my therapist, she is so enthusiastic about helping her patients get the best session as she explained my treatment plan, addressed any concerns, pain or discomfort I may have during my session. I felt motivated and involved with my rehabilitation process. Thank you!
Sonia Smith"
"Benchmark at Windy Hill brought me back to life.  One year after foot surgery I could barely walk and within two months I was back to running, jumping and training with zero pain.  What a positive experience and a positive environment.  Thank you Sara and Nicole ! ! !"
Great people. Extremely knowledgeable and got me back to normal in no time!
My experience at benchmark was very good they   treat me with respect and they help you to achieve all your goals I would recommend benchmark on windy hill to anyone including my family.
I am so glad I chose Benchmark to do my rehab. I had a torn labrum from a weightlifting accident. The doctor told me it would take a year to fully recover. 2 Days after the surgery I was at Benchmark starting PT. Only 5 months later I was back to doing all my normal movements throughout the day. Now it‚Äôs been 7 months and I‚Äôm back in the gym lifting weights like normal. I‚Äôm so thankful for Benchmark and the care they provided. I highly recommend this place. And Sarah Roberts deserves a promotion! She‚Äôs the best!
Great üëç place to get you back after any injury very friendly staff all around GREAT place of business.
Very professional and experienced
Great !!!
"(Translated by Google) Each of the people who work in this institution is extremely professional, but the most important thing is the pleasant treatment they have for the patients who visit this place, one feels at home there, I love being in this environment.

"Millie and the entire staff is amazing! Three members of our family were patients with different issues and we all had great results. Millie did a great job of breaking down our goals and getting us back to the activities we love. Everyone there is friendly, knowledgeable and care about their patients."
I'm very happy with my rehab at PT Solutions.  I learn so much information from Amy and her touch in manipulating my joints is perfect.  She is creative with exercises and I like her PT plan.
"Before my knee surgery on December last year, I visited several PT facilities to see which one I feel comfortable to be working with them. After visiting a few places, my last stop was at PT Solution in Lower Roswell. I was impressed with the cleanliness and openness of the facilities. There were people there, but didn't feel crowed. Once Millie sat me down on the working bed and talked me through the procedure, I liked it even more. After the surgery, I spent 6 months with Sarah and a little bit with Millie. Once in a while, I met different professional therapists  from different PT solution locations. I liked everyone of them. They always brought me different perspective and explained me why they want me to do this and that. Through 6 months, I really enjoyed working with Sarah. She‚Äôs not only listening to my problems, but also searching the way to address my pain and resolve it every time. I, never once, feel like I didn‚Äôt want to go to PT. If I have to fix another knee, this PT solution will be the one I will go back there. Thanks both Millie and Sarah, including all staff there at PT Solution. You helped me put my walk back together after the surgery. Thanks all of you."
"I am enjoying my visits at PT Solutions.  After 20+ years of pain and numerous chiropractor visits, I am finally feeling the road to recovery after only a week with PT!"
Friendly and knowledgeable staff.
"1. PT Solutions of Lower Roswell has a great location for my taste. There are lots of businesses around their location if I needed them, including a library. But most important for me as far as location is concerned is my travel time to and from the physical training.
2. Staff upbeat, responsive, responsible and cheerful, and still put me through the ringer. ( Which means I am made aware of goals I need to work on.)"
"This provider bills you as an Outpatient Hospital, which seems to enable them to charge higher than a regular physical therapy rehab facility. Shop around before you engage them, especially if you are on a High Deductible Health Plan. Ask for the CPT code that they'll probably bill you against. Then talk to your insurance provider to get ""cost to you"" estimates for your preferred therapy providers. Good luck navigating the American Healthcare System!

Edit 02/2021: In looking at details, they've billed me as ""Wellstar Windy Hill Hospital"", which is 9 miles away. They look like an outpatient physical therapy clinic and are setup like one but claim to be a hospital on their bill. This is probably the reason they're contracted at a higher rate with the insurance companies. Rather than call it outright ""Healthcare Fraud"", it is probably a loophole in the healthcare system. Other outpatient physical therapy clinics nearby charge $100 (even without insurance) for the same service that you provided and billed more than 3x."
Millie went above and beyond to help both of my sons. She is knowledgeable in her practice and genuinely cares about her patients.  I highly recommend her as a physical therapist!
Millie is a wonderful person and all the co-workers as well. There is always a welcoming smile! I was walking with a limp for several years & she was able to find the cause of it and treat it. And today that pain has gone. I would recommend her to all those seeking physiotherapy.
"Very tough.  Very Professional.  Truly a team.  They give 110% every day,  They are absolutely the best physical therapy team that I have worked with.  They maintain strict focus on the goal of getting you to your baseline or better from an injury or surgery.  Definitely 5 thumbs up, WAY UP!!!"
"I had a knee replacement in March 2019 and had my first appointment on April 15, 2019. My therapist, Millie addressed my knee but also the Arthritis pain in my hip and back. She has a unique manner to keep you at ease but push you to achieve a good recovery. All of the aides and Therapists are friendly and address a patient's needs with care and concern. I definitely recommend this Therapy Clinic."
"I'd had back problems for years with herniated and bulging discs. Since physical therapy, I've been problem free for 10 months and counting. Incredible therapists. Millie is fantastic."
"I enjoyed my time with the PT Solutions staff very much- from the very pleasant receptionist to the comfortable atmosphere to the VERY knowledgeable staff of therapists.  Millie, the main therapist,  knew exactly what to do to help me get better.  I would recommend PT Solutions to anyone seeking serious help!"
"I have had chronic back and hip issues for 20+ years. Having tried PT and spinal injections in the past with limited or bad results, I was directed to Chelsey Powell at PT Solutions. Thanks to Chelsey, for the first time in a long time, I am, essentially, pain-free, have great range of motion and can enjoy all the physical activities I love. Thank you Chelsey!!!!"
This staff changed my life! They have helped me so much. It's an added bonus that they are a blast to hang out with and make PT so fun! The entire team is so friendly and funny and they have great taste in music.  Go to PT Solutions Lower Roswell Rd!
"I‚Äôve been seeing Millie and team for a few months now due to injuries incurred from an auto accident. Could not be more pleased with the level of service and expertise. Millie knows what she‚Äôs doing, and has helped immensely with pain management and my recovery.

From a business standpoint, they‚Äôve been very helpful with making sure the paperwork is filed properly, and making sure my insurance requirements are met. It has been seamless.

Front desk people are great about helping with scheduling issues, and the automated appointment reminders are helpful.

Stop putting up with the pain, and go see PT Solutions Lower Roswell!"
"Great experience! Chelsea is awesome! She has been able to really help me by not only focusing on the injured area, but finding the root cause of the pain. Great improvements in such a short time!"
I went to this location twice a week for close to year for rehab after a surgery. The team there is great Millie is an awesome and very knowledgeable lead. The staff is always friendly and helpful.
Very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  their approach to physical therapy has worked much better than facilities I have gone to in the past.  I would highly recommend them for any physical therapy needs.
What a great team. Everyone was so helpful and friendly! Would highly recommend to anyone looking to improve overall health.
"There is a very good group of educated physical therapists who know what they are doing at East Cobb Location.  This experience has helped me very much.  I am very glad I am doing this,   From: Liz Cooper"
In recovering from a total knee replacement I ave found PT Solutions in the Parkaire Shopping Center to combine a people centered atmosphere with knowledgeable and diligent professionals.  I feel confident in working toward a successful rehabilitation and give my wholehearted recommendation.
Awful service. They charged me $504 for total one hour of evaluation and physical therapy. I had much better results at other physical therapy places.
Great experience. Brandon and Millie are committed to helping me get better.
Impressed at how fast I was able to heal.  Really nice people.  The facility is nice and clean.
Millie is the best! I am back to training for an Ironman thanks to some pre and post workout exercises I learned at PT Solutions.
I have been exceptionally pleased with each staff member! Great energy & environment!! My favorite part of rehab for my shoulder surgery!!!!
"Great staff.  Easy location.  Clean, well maintained, would recommend."
I am going on my third week of PT at PT Soultions and I am amazed with everyone there!  From my first encounter with Katie Gilstrup to my PT Millie Parekh and everyone else assoicated with my sessions are just friendly and helpful and encouraging.  Millie always makes me aware of my progress and wether or not we are on track and just could not say enough.  I would encourage anyone that needs outside PT to come here.
Am into my second week and it's all good !
MILLIE AND CHELSEY ARE THE BEST THERAPIST EVER!
Millie listens and explains the whats and  whys of the exercises she has you do.
They helped me with my knee problem
They fixed me!









"Unfortunately I have needed physical therapy more than once this year for different areas of concern.  But very fortunately ATI Physical Therapy on W Gerogia Road in Simpsonville is a God send.  Dr. Nadine Tuttle is a genius! She has come up with clever ways to treat my conditions.  She is patient and kind.  In fact the whole staff is great!  They understand there are good days and bad days and they work patiently with you so that you can have more good days overall.  I can't thank them enough for the work they do and for the attitude they have while doing it.  I highly recommend this office to anyone dealing with physical pain that is willing to do the work to make it better.  You won't find more support , creativity, or whole person care anywhere else."
Haven't started treatment yet. Staff seems friendly; the girlfriend likes likes her therapist. It's a convenient location for us. The place is less crowded than their other sites and everyone is required to wear masks. We like that.
"Great caring and professional team! They met and accomplished all my needs. Greet you at the door by name and make you feel so welcomed. Referring ATI Physical Therapy West Georgia Rd., Simpsonville, SC to everyone."
"The ATI physical therapy team is awesome I appreciate Abby, Nadyne, and Asia at the West Georgia Road Simpsonville SC location. They are all fun and so helpful with getting my knees back into shape. Thank you for helping me be successful and keeping me motivated since visiting June to August 2021. I highly recommend you give ATI Physical Therapy a chance you won't be disappointed at all."
The best staff! Nadyne always made sure I was informed and kept up to date with my progress! She always pushed me but listened when things were painful! I always felt important and heard! I am so thankful for their guidance!
"I have been going to ATI physical therapy for about 2 months now due to having a bicep tendon repair amongst other issues I have had  gotten done with my shoulder prior to moving from Upstate NY to the Greenville SC area.I only have positive things to say about Nadyne and Abbie.They are amazing at what they do and they listen.They are an amazing team together.Also ,I love Asia whom has been so very helpful as well and has helped me out with many things too.They all make you feel comfortable and have bubbly personalities."
"This was my first experience with physical therapy so I was a bit skeptical in the beginning. I felt better about the process after the initial appointment, though. Dr. Tuttle (Nadyne), was always knowledgeable and helpful. I could tell she was there for me. She even printed exercises for an unrelated issue that I have. Nadyne‚Äôs assistant, Abby, was much the same as Nadyne with the addition of advanced massage therapy skills from a previous career. They work well together. The receptionist, Asia, was always friendly and there to help when needed. It might seem like I‚Äôm laying it on a little thick, but I believe in giving credit where it is due. Cheers."
"Can't say enough about my great experience at ATI Simpsonville's Georgia Road site.  I went in with weakness and pain and left with strength and soreness (okay, yes I was sore from all those great exercises Nadyne prescribed for me!).  Nadyne is well versed in the needs of patients who come in for help with their pain. I loved working with her and quickly realized her goals for me were the same as mine.  She is most competent, knowledgeable and fun to work with.  She has the education and experience to boot.  Thank you Nadyne!"


"Update from last review:
I had my TKR (total knee replacement),
The staff is absolutely üíØfantastic!  Started therapy just 2 days after surgery,  started with a rolling walker, within a week walking with a cane, now 4 weeks out of surgery, I'm having no pain, stopped taking pain meds, Riding a bike,, getting ready to take a kayak trip next week. I owe my quick recovery to the wonderful staff at Bench mark. Totally LOVE the staff! They are the best, professional and courtesy abounds!"
Very professional and a great staff. I highly recommend Benchmark on Victory Dr. Mark helped me to walk again from a knee injury. I am very pleased . Thank you Mark you're the Best.
"Had a great experience with Mark and all of his staff. Helpful and knowledgeable, easy to schedule appointments and looked forward to my sessions. Would recommend to anyone."
"Very pleased w. my treatment & results.
Highly recommended."
"Came in with an escalating inflamed hamstring due to repetitive stress from running. Was very much at the end of my rope as I was 1/3 into training for my first 50k ultra marathon. Mark calmed me down, identified the problem, and gave me a great routine to work through on my own time.

I went here out of pocket and did not regret it in any way. In total it took 3 sessions to get me back on track - My race is next week and I managed to build milage and strength while treating the injury - Mark was super engaged, often answering texts and emails as my training weeks progressed.

An absolute asset for athletic injuries - Mark saved the day and kept me in the race."
Going into benchmark I was scared that it would be hard but I wanted to walk right again I have been going to benchmark since January 2019 and I have had some major surgeries they truly have helped me a lot sometimes i feel down and walking in there their energy is everything it lifts your spirit and it make you want to feel better to push they have helped me physically and mentally they are caring understanding and they are hands on from Rachel to Mark they are awesome I wouldn‚Äôt want to go anywhere else
Best physical therapist in Savannah :)
I was afraid that my knee is going to take time to heal; but Mark knew how to deal with it and now I feel way better. Thank you!
"Unfortunately, we were both deeply disappointed with the care we received at the clinic. While doing my research to find a PT clinic in Savannah I called to inquire about the clinic's model. The Office Manager spoke about the length of the appointments, whether or not aides or assistants were used to treat patients, and the modalities/type of therapy utilized. I was explicit in my expectation that I would be treated by a DPT for the entire appointment, and that I was looking for a clinic that used a combination of manual therapy and modalities such as cupping and scraping to treat my neck and shoulder injuries. I was frustrated that each of my two appointments, and my husband's initial evaluation, were completed in 40 minutes or less when we were told our appointments would be an hour long. Despite being assured that my PT would be working with me the entire time, Mark wandered away from me several times during my appointment to work with other patients who were being treated by students under his supervision.  Even more frustrating was Mark's approach to treatment. Rather than utilizing the time to treat my neck and shoulder with manual therapy, we spent the majority of the time doing exercises together. I believe that the best approach to Physical Therapy is a blend of manual therapy, movement correction, and an individually tailored HOME exercise program. Unfortunately, the clinic failed on all three accounts."
I have been going to Benchmark Physical Therapy for over a month now and my experience has been great. Both secretaries and Dr. Mark Powers are very welcoming and accommodating to your needs. The progress I have made has been amazing and I would highly recommend this location to anyone in need of physical therapy.
"Everyone is friendly, eager  to assist  and attentive.  They listen to your concerns.  The staff is amazing."
"I went to Dr. Mark Powers for about 3 months for a back injury.  His whole team was extremely friendly, supportive and encouraging the entire time.  From the first visit, I was reassured repeatedly about finding methods to diminish my pain and increase strength and mobility so I could get back to my normal activities.  It was a joy to visit the clinic every time and I saw improvement every session.  I had little experience with physical therapy before this injury, but had such a great experience here!  I would recommend this place over and over again!"
"Mark Powers is incredibly knowledgeable, patient, communicative and holds you accountable to do your part towards your own recovery and PREhabilitation afterward. I went in for back pain that had been recurring on and off for almost two years. I was afraid of ‚Äúreinjury‚Äù. I cannot emphasize enough the confidence, tools and information about the neurological aspect of recovery that Mark empowered me with. I have not had back issues since and it‚Äôs been over two years since treatment. It is because of him and his practice at Benchmark PT that I was confidently deadlifting within two weeks of starting to see him when I didn‚Äôt think I was going to be able to pick up a barbell for months if not years. Mark reassured me that I was not broken. I learned more about what I need to do to consistently keep myself moving pain free. Thank you, Mark, because even over two years later I‚Äôm grateful for your treatment and attention.

I must add that having been in the fitness industry for several years, it is refreshing that Mark is innovative, clearly researches well beyond what is expected of professionals in his industry AND takes the time to help other aspiring therapists studying under him. Exemplary on all levels."




My first experience with Physical Therapy was a success thanks to the attentive doctors. I felt like I was making progress in their care and am so happy to be back where I need to be. The atmosphere is very friendly and inviting and they want to make sure you are improving with each visit. Definitely recommend if you are in the area.
The therapists are happy people and it is catching!  It would be hard to remain grumpy in their atmosphere.  I know.  I've gone in feeling pretty lousy but I always come out feeling happy and re-energized. They always make me feel better both physically and emotionally.  A great choice for physical therapy!
This was my second experience with the Sugar Hill location. The first time around I had 12 weeks and finished with every personal goal achieved. When I needed it I chose to return to this location. The results from this round of therapy was just as amazing! I like the friendliness of the office staff and the therapists. Kelsey  and Riyaz showed concern for me and were very empathetic towards my individual needs. I'm feeling better and  I highly recommend Benchmark in Sugar Hill.
"My experience with BenchMark was great! Kelsey was absolutely amazing at keeping me on track and making sure I was doing everything with the proper form and in the correct manner. She, along with the entire staff, were always friendly and I love to joke around and have fun while doing something very serious. They fit into this mold and I really looked forward to seeing all of them each week. From Sandy the receptionist to all the helpers at the location to Kelsey I have nothing but praise for BenchMark!"
This is a great facility to get help for physical therapy. They treat you like family and are truly willing to help in anyway possible. Ask for Lindsey if you go. She‚Äôs amazing!!
"Everyone at Benchmark is professional, thorough and kind.  The therapy performed is top notch and on target.  I highly recommend!"
I had a great experience with benchmark. Right when I walked through the front door they made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I could say with confidence that they are genuinely concerned with helping in every way they can to facilitate my full recovery and in my case getting back to doing something I very much enjoy which is sports.
"I have been to this location 3 times for various issues. I have always found them to be efficient, great listeners and genuinely concerned with my progress. When I was discharged this time I told them I hoped I wouldn‚Äôt be back but it was comforting to know they are there always there if I need them!  Would highly recommend."
Lindsey is the best. Have had 3 different sessions with her for a very long recovery. Her and Sandy are very helpful and willing to go that extra mile. Highly recommended
One goes to PT to solve a problem. You will  notice knowledgable pleasant therapists and helpers.You leave with improved health and also made new friends  from front to back.
I had an excellent experience with my post surgery shoulder rehabilitation at this location. The entire staff from techs to PT‚Äôs to office manager were great to work with. Great team and excellent communication.
"As a whole the place isn‚Äôt too bad. Everyone seemed friendly with the exception of Paul.  Rubbed me the wrong way from day 1. I haven‚Äôt even finished therapy and I am not going back, can‚Äôt deal with his attitude. They do chit chat a lot which I don‚Äôt mind. My daughter tagged along and asked me why they weren‚Äôt doing their job lol So it‚Äôs obvious even to an 8 year old. Like I said I don‚Äôt mind it though.  The front office messed my insurance up but in their defense it was confusing to begin with and they figured it out relatively quickly.  Sorry Paul not a happy customer but the people that essentially do everything anyways rock."
"Staff is friendly but the therapists are too busy chatting about weekend plans and after work activities.They need to pay closer attention to their patients and how patients are completing their exercises . I also think they are not trained to deal with complex cases. After my complex spine fusion surgery my Neurosurgeon recommended physicial therapy. The therapist wanted to massage the area of the back that had the incisions and  manipulate that area to where I was in pain for days . I moved to an all together different place and the difference was like night and day. Therapists watched closely my form when I did the exercises. They were well trained  ,no chit chat there and constant communication with my doctor."
Great team! Always professional to the clients and coworkers. They care about your well-being. I was pleased and I would return if needed.
Highly recommend BenchMark in Buford. The physical therapist and assistants are understanding and very knowledgeable. Very professional and friendly!
Highly recommended benchmark they do a fantastic job the care you receive is great the whole staff is owsom.
Receptionists don't seem to understand insurance so beware!  They are also really rude.
"GOODDAY & GOD BLESS US
My experience was excellent! Sandy will be your first contact who will ask HOW CAN WE HELP YOU.
Paige is the DIRECTOR OF PHYSICAL THERAPY because she has the degrees of education and is aware of every patients needs she and her staff are treating. Paige may not put her hands on you but she knows who you are and what you need to recover. Paige is the quarterback with a computer full of treatment plans as her play book and therapists to begin your recovery.
I have been in therapy treatment at other companies that assigned multiple patients to one therapist. At BENCHMARK I was assigned to Lindsey(therapist) and Kelsey(trainee). Lindsey would print out my exercises and Kelsey would help me thru today's program. After my warmup with Kelsey I would do one on one table time with Lindsey. Here Lindsey would discuss what treatments we were doing and how they would impact my recovery. We would discuss my daily activities at home and what degree of difficulty I was experiencing. Paige would check in with me.
I had 2 total knee replacements within 3 months because BENCHMARK and THE THERAPISTS made recovery easy and thorough. The programs and THE PEOPLE are the best. The regional director visited one day and helped me with a hand issue.
My only suggestion would be to add hand warmers for the therapists."

"Great place. Had knee surgery and they helped me all the way. Great staff, knowledgeable."

Everyone at Bench Mark is friendly and very helpful. They gave me great care in my rehabilitation with them. My PT Tony was very patient and knowledgeable in helping me get through my rehabilitation.
"Excellent service and staff! They are very caring and treat you with respect. Also, willing to help you with any concerns you have with your therapy. If you follow through with your therapy routine and do the home physical therapy between sessions, you will feel a positive change."
Friendly Staff!  All therapists were professional and friendly.  Nice environment.  Loved the music.  Got me back on my feet and relieved most of my spinal and neck pain after my car accident.  Gave me the exercises and tools to manage myself after discharge.  Physical Therapy is definitely better than just taking pain meds.  You have to put in the work but in the long run....it‚Äôs so worth it!!
Therapist are great. Very caring and attentive to your needs.  I will definitely recommend  BenchMark Physical Therapy to others.
"I‚Äôve been a patient with benchmark since January 26 ,2021 My OT therapist is awesome  Mallory Hammer Rocks ! I‚Äôm ver impressed by my hand and fingers as well my wrist movement didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be this far along with my therapy as I am but thanks to Mallory knowledge on hands I‚Äôve have progress well !! If your in need I would refer you to Benchmark in Fayetteville, Ga  ! Everyone is great as well but my OT Rocks !!"
"I have utilized Benchmark PT in Fayetteville on three different occasions, and each time left stronger and with a much improved range of motion. They are knowledgeable, professional and their ability to Needle, as a treatment, is a game changer."
"Dr. Tony was very patient but focused on my rehab needs. I am very happy to have gone to Benchmark as he helped me tremendously. I whole heartedly recommend BenchMark for your recovery whatever that may be.
Remember ""YOU CAN DO IT!"""
"Awesome and friendly staff! Physical Therapy with Benjamin Lins, has been so helpful. I'm really going to miss seeing everyone, on a weekly basis."
If you are in pain. This is the best place to go for a any kind of physical therapy. They have the best service (from receptionist(s) to physical therapist(s)) in the city/county. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
I had a very unskilled therapist. She attempted to make a yoke splint for my hurt hand and failed miserably every attempt. Finally she said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs as good as I can get it‚Äù. The splint did not fit and was very painful to wear. It was made of wax and they billed my insurance 1200 dollars and made me pay over 200 out of pocket for something that hindered the progress of my recovery. I would go anywhere else possible
"This is an exceptional place to go for physical therapy! I spent 9 months there with an extraordinary therapist, Daniel, who went well beyond expectations for this complicated case.  The atmosphere at the Fayetteville Benchmark is what makes all the difference.  The highly skilled therapists use humor and fun to help you ""enjoy"" therapy while providing the best in patient care.  They are a great TEAM including the office personnel. It is amazing to be able to say that I actually enjoyed physical therapy. I improved greatly and this is where I will return to in the ""likely"" event I will need more therapy in the future."
"I had a great experience at the Fayetteville Benchmark location. The staff was amazing! Really treated everyone like family. This made every visit a pleasure to attend. My physician was awesome too. She helped me get my knee back into possibly better condition that ever. Would recommend this office to anyone.

Chris"
"Former clinical rotation OT student who had a great 3 month experience. The staff is wonderful and fun-loving; the culture is inviting/comfortable. My Clinical instructor- Megan, OT and co- assist Ben, DPT are colorfully experienced with knowledge and personality and love to teach as well as all the staff; I learned a lot and had fun doing so!The staff is full of vibrant youthful energy, professionalism and a desire to assist each person with a smile. I highly recommend BenchMark Physical Therapy of Fayetteville, GA for your outpatient rehab needs."
"My name is Toni.  I resisted having physical therapy because I had several bad experiences for previous injuries, but when I met Emmanuel all that changed.  He was absolutely wonderful with me and my surgeon Dr. Steven Wertheim  thought he did a wonderful job as well. He made it fun and he genuinely cared about my recovery."
My first visit here was great. Staff was really nice and professional. Natasha the therapist was very patient and answered all questions and did a great work. Looking forward to next appointments
Natasha is the best! üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ


"Outstanding staff!  Each interaction has been professional and positive.  PT isn't supposed to be fun and indeed the pain that sometimes accompanies the session is intense, however all staff members are congenial, professional and truly caring."
"After my son had brain surgery, he was left alone on a bike and overheated! Something he was NOT supposed to have done, then they tried to cover it up! In addition, O/T person very inappropriate, making comments about the ""size"" of my chest while my son was in therapy!"



The staff here is awesome - especially Jalecia. She is always so helpful. Brian and Tony are great as well. 10/10 would recommend.
Awesome staff! Very helpful after my ACL surgery. Everyone was friendly and down to earth from the front desk to the therapist. I definitely recommend for anyone who needs to be fixed
This place is awesome! I went here after a car accident and Brian was really informative and awesome he went above to advocate for me with my doctor to explain to them how important it was for me to continue treatment. Definitely would recommend!
Staff here is awesome. Brian is really personable and gives everyone the one on one time they need. Although I am a special case I have watched Brian rehab people back to their goal in a short amount of time.
Brian and team are awesome to work with. All were so compassionate and caring!!!! I would recommend everyone to use this facility in Evans. Love them and will miss them when my sessions end!!!
Everyone is so friendly and helpful.
"Jalecia is the best, always will be! Brian and Kaylea are the G.O.A.T.S . Go to Brian if you want coffee!!"
I have had a great experience as a patient at PT Solutions. Both of the therapist that I have worked with. Where both super friendly an accommodating to my injury
"Very professional and knowledgeable.
Best physical therapist in town!"
With a severe reaction to knee replacement surgery I approached PT Solutions with distrust and no hope . The professional care and encouragement of Brian Harder gave me back my hope and taught me motivation and pride in my body as well as trust and communication . I watched as other clients became inspired under the skillful training of Mr Harder . The atmosphere of acceptance and compassion never alters in this wonderful place ! Hooray for Brian and PT Solutions Evans !!
Friendly staff and very efficient.
"Professional, wonderful, knowledgeable, friendly, encouraging, caring, prompt, helpful, .....Great people!"
"This group is beyond competent. Their professionalism, energy level and sincere concern for all their patients has to be experienced to be believed. They not only make you feel comfortable but they provide constant  encouragement to push through the necessary pain of PT. They guide you though the recovery process. This place is not just PT but therapy for the mind, you leave feeling great. Fantastic people; Stew, Jess and Lindsey, thank you."
Best physical therapy place I‚Äôve ever been to. The place is set up very nicely with wall mounted TVs which you can see from all angles. The therapy tables are all for one individual as opposed to shared tables like in some places. Very clean and organized. They are very flexible and work your schedule to suit your needs. Best of all though is their cordial and benevolent nature. They are the best - and my family and I will never go anywhere else.
The staff is super nice and very accommodating for you personal needs.
"Professional but express a sense of caring.  Staff are welcoming and always explaining what the exercise will do.  Always willing to explain what they are attempting to do.  Although I dislike exercising, Stew makes it fun and is always so encouraging.  I would definitely recommend PT Solutions for all of your physical therapy needs."
"I have been going to PT Solutions for physical therapy following knee replacement surgery and am extremely happy with the progress they are helping me make.  The therapists are very knowledgeable, extremely encouraging, and are continually working to make each visit a positive experience.  I will definitely use PT Solutions for therapy following my next knee replacement surgery.  I highly recommend these therapists for your physical therapy needs"
I injured my knee at work. I have been going to pt for months before and after surgery.  The staff here have been so understanding and caring. They are patient and are very knowledgeable. I highly recommend pt solutions for any of your needs.
I had a great experience as a patient at PT Solutions of Evans. Both therapists were super knowledgeable and were able to ease my pain upon my first visit. Their dry needling technique was super helpful. Staff is very friendly. Highly recommend!!
"Excellent care from awesome people! Nice facility and the staff are always friendly, fun, and working to help you get better. I've had nearly constant pain for almost a year and after just a few weeks, I'm experiencing my first pain-free days. Stew is a phenomenal therapist who really pushes you, but he is committed to helping you heal and learn how to stay strong so you don't re-injure yourself. I've also done the dry-needling, which seems scary at first, but has helped tremendously. I feel like I'm finally seeing a light at the end of the tunnel since my back injury and I have Stew and the crew at PT Solutions to thank for it. Highly Recommend!!!"
My daughter loves going here. Jessica and all the other staff make us feel welcome and calm her nerves. They are the utmost professionals. They are giving my daughter and I the tools we need to get her better. This is a review for the Evans location.
I have really enjoyed the dry needling that Jessica does. I've been dry needled by other therapist before but Jessica really knows what she is doing. They also offer other services that have helped get me back into the gym without any pain in my shoulders. I would highly recommend this PT clinic if you are in the Evan's area.
"Let me just say, I am an extremely clumsy person. I first came here for an ankle injury that I did two years ago and it was never able to heal. I‚Äôve done physical therapy many times before but have never enjoyed it like I do here. They are so nice and get along great with everyone and have helped me in more ways than I could have imagined. They‚Äôre great on reminders on appointments and are amazing at working around YOUR schedule. Highly recommend to everyone!!!"
"PT Solutions is a very welcoming business.    Abby, at the appointment desk,  is a very friendly young lady.  with a nice smile.   Appointment times are kept prompt.
The therapist, Jessica and Sam are attentative to personal needs in exercises.      It is not boring to be there.

I am very hopeful, I will be better with their help."
"The staff is knowledgable, responsive, motivated and interested in improving your condition. They are looking to treat your condition and will challenge you to improve. The facility is nice and the staff is friendly."
"Kudos !! I‚Äôm receiving excellent treatment from highly skilled , well educated therapists. My results are awesome  I recommend this location."
My experience with PT Solutions has been Amazing. My back already feels better after only 2 visits. They are also working with me around my work schedule.
"I was referred to PT Solutions about two months ago because of a knee injury I suffered years ago that flared back up. Jessica and Stu were very informative, friendly & patient during the strengthening process. I recommend PT Solutions."
I had a really good experience Job shadowing  at PT Solutions. I learned a lot about what it takes to become a DPT. The staff are really good at creating a warm and positive atmosphere.
"Outstanding professionals that truly care about getting you well and mobile.Also, the receptionist is so accommodating and helpful."
The most friendly staff and environment you can get in physical therapy. Highly recommend!
"I highly recommend Pt Solutions for their warm, encouraging atmosphere and great workers. Stu has helped me greatly over these past three to four months."
"The team at PT Solutions is awesome.   They are welcoming, encouraging, and push you hard.  The work has improved my shoulder immensely."
"I love this place
The staff is absolutely wonderful üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
If I could I would give them 10 stars!!"
"Super friendly staff that are very helpful. If your looking for dry needling, this is the place!"
Great people !   Well trained and focused on success of each patient
Excellent care! Very patient & knowledgeable!
Professional and friendly. I would absolutely recommend them.
"Best PT I've ever been to.  Staff is friendly and professional.  Brian is creative and does not treat everyone the same.  He's willing to listen and help make a game plan that will work.  Trust him, he knows what he's doing and he made a big difference in my recovery.

Thank you all for your wonderful support!"








I have nothing but positive things to say about this place! My neck feels SO much better. Everyone here is wonderful! They also helped my Son get back to being a kid again. If I could give more star rating I would. We definitely recommend this place.
"Physical therapist was great, I say was as I left due to the immaturity and unprofessionalism of office staff. New hire seems to have the smile and charisma needed for the place. Don't need a dreary face/personality at entry when you are already suffering"
"I have not yet visited Benchmark for physical therapy but am seriously considering doing so after an initial exploratory visit on Friday where I met the Office Manager who was super friendly and amazingly helpful even though she was about to leave for the weekend.  What impressed me most are the educational credentials and information about my needed physical therapy treatment program by the head physical therapist Savannah who has her doctorate degree in Physical Therapy from the University of North Georgia.  After checking out the subject  PT degree program at UNG, I am even more impressed since the program takes nine semesters and 130 credit hours to complete.  I am an extremely conservative person so have only given a 4 Star rating at this time but will review and update my rating after completing the prescribed physical therapy program over the coming month."
"If you are under 40, I BEG you not to go here.  The staff is tremendously friendly, but I could not get out of physical therapy here fast enough.  The majority of their patients are older, and they failed to acknowledge that a 19 year old‚Äôs body will heal much differently and much quicker than a 50 year old‚Äôs.  I am a student at UGA and spent the first 4 weeks of my recovery after knee surgery with Benchmark because it was a school break.  My PT referral and plan were followed to a T, regardless of how much progress was made or how easy tasks seemed.  I was sure to mention that the surgeon said it was a very rigid guideline as opposed to a game plan that must be followed, but it seemed the therapists forgot they too were practicing professionals with their own judgement.  If I was still going to Benchmark, I would still be one week away from even starting to ease into running again (based on the prescription), but after spending weeks 5-11 (present) with UGA training staff and physical therapy, I have been cleared for full return to sport (including completion of a full jumping program, running program, and agility program after strength had returned to normal levels)"
They have helped me recover from a torn achilles tendon. Very friendly and helpful staff.
They've attacked my severe back pain and muscle spasms with a vengeance. Dry needling and exercises are relieving me of pain I've carried for decades. The staff is super friendly. Appointments are always on time. The best.
"Excellent team. Very professional , extremely helpful and knowledgable  I have been cared for by their team on several occasions for several years, on and off. I completely recommend them !"



"I CANNOT say enough amazing things about this BenchMark location, Kari Craker, and the entire staff here!!!! I originally started therapy for some shoulder instability issues and shortly after this I fractured my ankle severely rock climbing. When I started my PT for my ankle I began working with Kari and she has been absolutely fantastic. I got back to rock climbing and was even able to get back to horseback riding after my rehab. Kari was amazing and transitioned between my injuries/body areas seamlessly.

I felt truly cared for by everyone who worked here. Another one of the therapists, Meg, worked with me on several occasions if Kari was unavailable and she was so patient and encouraging. Julie at the front desk was always so helpful and kind, and all of the PT techs like Lyndsey and Meghan were welcoming and helpful too.  Kari and everyone else at BenchMark became the highlights of my weeks, and I'm genuinely sad that I no longer am going there. I genuinely looked forward to each and every session which is not something I ever expected to say about physical therapy. I could not recommend anyone a better place to go for their PT regardless of the problem!"
"Whenever you need hand therapy, be sure to see Nikki Mathis, Physical Therapist/hand specialist, at Benchmark in Kennesaw.  She has helped me immensely in my recovery from several surgeries. Nikki makes the whole process fast, meaningful and yes, even fun! You know you're doing work and making progress but the time passes quickly with her friendly conversation, professional technical approach, expertise and knowledge sharing. She treats every patient with personalized attention. Nikki patiently answers all questions and tells you how each exercise benefits the affected part of your hands/arm/shoulders/neck. She's excellent at giving demonstrations, teaching, therapeutic massage, needling, prescribing home exercises targeted to meet each person's own needs. You'll be happy in your recovery! I highly recommend Nikki Mathis, Physical Therapist to everyone."
"Best therapy facility ever! I have had therapy at other rehabilitation facilities, this was a very positive experience for me. I fractured my wrist and walked in with minimal flexibility.The therapist provided realistic goals that I could achieve while  pushing towards maximum
flexibility.
This is a very positive and friendly atmosphere, starting with the people at the front desk and permeating throughout the entire facility reflective to the other therapists.
I highly recommend Benchmark physical therapy."
"I cannot say enough good things about my experience.  This was my first time having physical therapy and I was unsure of what it would entail.  Each of my concerns was addressed, and thorough explanations of what caused my pain and the processes to alleviate the pain were provided so that I understood each step of my therapy. Ben, my therapist, worked with me to find exercises I was able to do not only during the sessions, but at home.  All of the employees are friendly and caring, and the environment is a positive one such that I looked forward to every visit.  I started with unbearable pain in my knees and ended almost completely pain free; I only wish I‚Äôd known about physical therapy as an option to manage arthritis years ago."
"What an awesome experience! I went in on crutches after a knee injury and now I'm walking! Ben determined the exact cause and treated it expertly. He was truly invested in how to restore my mobility. All of the staff was supportive of my recovery, friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this facility!"
"I was a short-term patient (around 3 weeks) for occupational therapy for my wrist/thumb. Nikki was excellent! She worked with me and targeted the issue within my first visit. It was obvious that her goal was to do everything she could to prevent me from having to have surgery. Every visit was focused on me getting better and after 6 visits (your mileage my vary) I was quickly on the road to recovery. Nikki provided me with excellent resources (exercises, braces, etc.) to help me continue my recovery after I had to cancel further visits due to returning to work. Thanks, Nikki, for all your help and great conversation during my therapy sessions."
"All of the staff and therapists here are fantastic!  Nikki (OT) worked on my shoulder after surgery on my rotator cuff.  She was FANTASTIC.  She listened carefully to how I was feeling, hunted down and fixed the places where there was tension and I had huge knots in my muscles that had developed over months of limited use of my arm.  Whatever was bothering me at any session, she spent the time figuring out how to fix it.  Some visits I was on her table for over 30 minutes while she massaged, stretched, worked on trigger points, and figured out what was causing my biceps/triceps/deltoids to seize up.  The fact that she was willing to give me so much personal attention at each visit gave me a lot of confidence in everything she was recommending I do at home.  I really felt like we were working together as a team to fix my arm, and I appreciated that she asked about and regularly followed up on what was most important to me so that I could get back to feeling ""normal"" as quickly as possible.  I cannot recommend Nikki highly enough - she was fantastic.  (Also, her hands are INSANELY STRONG!!)  I worked with other therapists there as well (for needling and substituting on sick days)  and everyone in this office was fantastic to work with.  I would not hesitate to recommend the Chastain office."
"I chose to come to Benchmark Physical Therapy because the location was close to my home. I have had experiences in the past with a few other therapists, but was not anxious to return to them. Fortunately, I was paired up with Nikki after my thumb  arthroplasty surgery. She has given me exercises that have helped me regain movement and strength in my thumb/ hand and has made therapy fun and enjoyable. Not once did I feel more than a slight discomfort, and was able to follow her instructions for continuing my therapy at home.

Although I am looking forward to getting rid of my last thumb brace, I will miss laughing with Nikki and comparing our crazy socks that we both enjoy wearing.

I see my surgeon next week and I am sure he will be proud of what has been accomplished through Nikki‚Äôs expertise and I will surely benefit now and in the future from her care. You can be sure that I will request Nikki once again when it is time for surgery on my right thumb early next year.

Thanks to all at Benchmark for making my experience a positive one!"
"Benchmark Physical Therapy in Kennesaw is EXCELLENT ALL AROUND!!! They provided excellent Customer Service, excellent Physical Therapy, & in my case, worked with me financially. I am BEYOND GRATEFUL FOR THEM! I was involved in a horrible car accident in March that left my arm badly broken. I needed emergency surgery and afterwards needed to get my strength & nerves back right before having to go back to work. By the AMAZING work of my Occupational Therapist, Nikki Mathis, I was able to get that accomplished within a little under 3 months! I HIGHLY recommend her & Benchmark Physical Therapy to anyone that needs it!"
"I love my hand therapist Nikki Mathis she is amazing.  She shows me my limitations and progress with grace. Even if I don‚Äôt want to see my limitations. But is always encouraging of my progress even if slow. She is compassionate, caring and a true to her word hand therapist.  Even when I dont want to hear my limitations.  I can‚Äôt even say how much she has encouraged me to reach for the beyond and has pushed my therapy to miles I never thought I could reach!!! She is my inspiration and life coach. Thank you so much Nikki. You mean the world to me and always will. You have made this Nurse of 30 years whom has a jaded perception of medicine feel hopeful and elated as to what medical perfesionals has to offer.  I am forever grateful Nikki Mathis to you. Thank you,  Laura"
"Recent patient testimonial: Michael O‚ÄôBrien

This was my 4th time to use Benchmark for PT. Niki was my PT for this finger injury and I am completely satisfied with the progress we have made. I can now use my hand with no limitations and no pain or discomfort. Niki was very engaged with my treatment and progress and her personality made my visits go quickly. She is an asset to Benchmark and working with other PT‚Äôs like Kari makes this Benchmark location the best!  I can‚Äôt wait for my next injury or surgery so I can visit again‚Ä¶..!"
I really enjoyed the care and attention provided to my rehabilitation by Nikki. I highly recommend her for all hand therapy!!!
I am not one to typically write these reviews but I did have a particularly negative experience. My rehab protocol after surgery was specific and I wanted to make sure it was followed. I did not feel comfortable. My gut was telling me that something was wrong. After visiting my doctor for a follow up and discussing PT they were slightly alarmed and noted that the protocol was not being followed to the extent where it may have damaged my repair or potentially cause it to fail. I was advised to switch to a different PT location.
Amazing staff!! Friendly and competent. Meg has my knee feeling a lot stronger!
This is a great place for therapy. They have great customer service skills and the therapists are top notch. I would recommend this place to anyone.
"Dr. Kari Craker and the team at Benchmark Chastain took my daughter from a torn ACL(pre-surgery PT) to a Division I college soccer scholarship.
Dr. Kari not only brought my daughter back to full mobility, the rehab was so well done and thorough that as she was scouted the most common question about her injury she was ‚ÄúWhich knee did you tear?‚Äù Dr. Kari worked to bring Sarah back to her peak performance with emphasis on movement and the rebuilding of her strength. Dr. Kari along with the Benchmark team kept my daughter engaged, motivated, encouraged, and hopeful. Coming back from an ACL tear is a year long process and we could not be happier for how well my daughter recovered.  We highly recommend Benchmark Chastain & Dr. Kari for your physical therapy."
Kari at Benchmark-Chastain was fantastic! She was able to help me resolve my back issues quickly and efficiently.
"Soft people skills trumpet hard skills of knowledge, when people are treated as lesser than - loss of business will follow.

Benchmark as a whole is good minus when a physical therapist unknowingly puts his/her stress on a client through too much force and getting the wrong spots causing more harm than good.

Please read ""Leadership and Self-deception"" by the Arbinger institute"
These people are awesome! They do a great job and are fun to spend the time around.
Kristina did a wonderful job helping me strengthen my neck after my doctor recommended PT for issues with my C3-C7. I‚Äôm feeling much better and highly recommend her and will definitely see her in the future if I need PT again.
"Their commitment, and care that they give the clients."




"I recently had a total hip replacement.  I was fortunate to have physical therapy at the BenchMark location in Oakwood, GA.  The entire staff is absolutely wonderful.  Cody and several other physical therapists worked diligently with me.  My confidence to walk correctly was instilled due to their expertise and commitment to my well being.  Cody (and the other therapists) explained the exercises and answered any and all questions I had.  I highly recommend BenchMark-Oakwood, GA for any physical therapy needs.  Thank you BenchMark for having an excellent Team at this location."
"I had a better than expected experience. All the staff is so friendly and professional. Everyone works as a team. My Physical Therapist Barrett was a God send. He got me back to life, work and a good night's sleep without pain. He is a true healer and cares about your progress. I highly recommended his and Benchmarks services."
This is the best set of people I have worked with. They always put people first and ensure things are done the right way. I did not only recover from my patellar tendonitis but learned a lot by being around them. Thank you so much.
Great place there staff is the best if you need physical therapy benchmark is the place 100 percent satisfied thanks to all
"Great facility, and great physical therapists to get you back to achieving your goals. Everyone is so sincere and wants the overall best for the patient."
"I love Benchmark Oakwood!  I have been there for physical therapy for two rotator cuff surgeries and have worked with both Cody and Barrett, and their part time PT‚Äôs and assistants. They are professional, knowledgeable, and sincere in their efforts to heal. You get positive feedback and encouragement to work hard. My husband has been there for PT for two rotator cuff surgeries and one knee replacement. We both feel like family here.  We have recommended Benchmark to numerous people who have all been very happy with them. We highly recommend Benchmark Oakwood to anyone and are grateful we found them."
"This place will tell you anything to get you in the doors so they can bill you astronomical fees for their ""so called"" Physical Therapy. When they first called after my Doctor's referral, I spoke with Britanny, the receptionist. I asked her how much would my visit be with my Insurance. She said she would look into it and call me back., She called me back and told me I would be responsible for 20% of the total bill. I asked her how much that would be and she said she had no idea. Well, I should have trusted my instincts and not tried Benchmark Therapy in Oakwood Georgia. I arrive and asked her ""had she found out the pricing for me"" and she said ""all she knew was I would owe 20% of the total"". I spent the next 40 minutes with Barret, who I must say is a nice and caring man, asking me questions about my neck pain. He had me look left, look right and asked me how I felt. Umm, I'm in pain, that's how I felt. I subsequently followed up with one 30 minute appointment where I was shown some stretching exercises.

When I received their bill for $367.00 after their adjustments (none are insurance payments), I was shocked and confused. Since that day, I have spent hours on the phone with their billing department who have repeated themselves over and over saying that I had to meet my deductible before the 20% would kick in. That's funny, Brittany, who repeatedly told me I would only pay 20% of the bill never mentioned that none of it would be covered until I paid my full deductible. NOT ONCE, NEVER.

My last phone call was January 4, 2019 to Benchmark Therapy in Oakwood where I received my therapy. Brittany was off and I was told she would call me Monday. Well, instead of Brittany calling me, she had Barret the therapist call me Monday January 7, 2019. Not sure why, he has nothing to do with billing??? He went on to tell me that apparently none of the bill would be covered by my insurance until I paid my full deductible. I explained to him that this is not what they told me when I was called by them and when I showed up in person for my ""Evaluation appointment"", which by the way is $384.00 before adjustments. He developed an attitude when I asked him what he could do to help me with this issue. Why am I surprised??? Another wasted 10 minutes on the phone with people who don't care.

So here I sit with perefect credit. I have worked hard my whole life to keep it that way. I am a person of honor and I pay my bills which is why I have perfect credit. Benchmark Therapy in Oakwood does NOT HONOR THEIR WORD. They apparently will say whatever is necessary to get you in the door. So I am at whits end after my 10th or so phone call with them about this bill. They are now threatening me with Collection which will affect my credit. I guess this is ""THEIR GAME"".

So NO, I would definitley NOT recommend Benchmark Therapy of Oakwood, GA for many reasons but mostly because of their UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR.

With much regret,
Mary Daneman, Gainesville GA."
Great place! Wonderful people! Very caring

"I have had a great experience at PT Solutions in Sandy Springs!  I went in, hardly able to move and unable to function, with a bulging/herniated disc.  Lauren is the back whisperer!  I saw her three times a week for the first two months.  Each week I saw improvement.  Three and a half months out now and I am better than the months before my injury.  I have also seen Dan and Lori Beth and both are fantastic.  You cannot go wrong!  I am being ""released"" which is great news but I will miss them and the friendly, fun and encouraging environment."
"Excellent service, knowledge and care. My sister has Parkinsons and is improving dramatically. Great take home exercises to keep her motivated and active. All of the staff is super! Very friendly and caring.
Thank you!"
"I decided to switch from another PT to PT Solutions for my second ACL tear after hearing good things from friends‚Ä¶and it was the best decision. Dan Vapne is a great physical therapist and always answers my endless amount of questions as thoroughly as possible (extremely knowledgeable as are the rest of the staff). In comparison to my last physical therapy experience, it is apparent the staff here really care about their patients. Another great thing I noticed was that they ensure you perform each exercise correctly even if it requires the slightest adjustment. Their attentiveness helps immensely, especially when recovering from difficult injuries. I highly recommend PT Solutions to anyone in need of rehabilitation!"
"The staff is very knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating. I worked with Dan and his team following two different injuries. He explained the treatments very well and adjusted them as needed and also based on feedback to achieve great results. The facility is well maintained, with plenty of free parking."
The therapists are so knowledgeable.  They explain what they are having you do and why.  They obviously care about their patients.  I have been to 3 to 4 other physical therapy practices but PT Solutions is my favorite!
"Dan is awesome!  He really wants to make sure you are healed, not just going to be back in his office in a month. This is the way PT SHOULD be!"
"I have been receiving physical therapy at this location for the past several months. I highly recommend this PT Solutions group!

They have done thorough and ongoing assessments of my goals, and have developed motivating and innovative activities to address them. My pain has been reduced and my strength and endurance has increased.

The skilled staff works collaboratively. The atmosphere is personal and supportive - - from the front desk to the therapists."
The best physical therapy operation that I‚Äôve ever seen. I love the people and the space cannot be beat. I look forward to my visits with my therapist. Excellent location in the middle of Sandy Springs.
"The BEST there is!! The therapists here are not only highly skilled and extremely knowledgeable, but they genuinely care about their patients and work hard to ensure that they are achieving progress with each session. The atmosphere is jovial, welcoming, and supportive. It is truly a pleasure to attend your appointments and at the end of each session, you will find yourself already looking forward to the next!"
"I have had an amazing experience at PT for myself and my daughter. Laura Beth, Lauren, and Daniel are all fabulous. They are responsive and made sure to address everything we needed. We have been through Physical Therapy at other places before, but not like here.......they are amazing!!!!! The front desk staff is also beyond helpful with scheduling and insurance."
"I have been working with Dan and the staff at PT Solutions to avoid knee surgery and have been very pleased with their dedication, professionalism and commitment to cleanliness. Dan is very thorough and explains how the therapy works on every level. I definitely recommend them."
"I have been to several PT facilities in the past few years, but the
team at PT Solutions is by far the best I have encountered.
My therapist Dan is great - he looks and listens carefully to my comments
and then applies his knowledge of appropriate exercises and massage
for my condition.
The entire team is very friendly and knows my name and I really appreciate that."
"At 43, I experienced my 1st serious accident in my life, a trimalleolar fracture with ligament damage in my left leg/foot basically broke everything in my lower left leg and was non weight Bering after intensive surgery for 10 weeks. I was then cleared for physical therapy. Because of the SEVERE dislike of my surgeon, I knew I did not want to complete my therapy at their office. My son mentioned to me that he had been to a nearby PT Solutions and recommended that I give them a try. I remember being terribly afraid of what to expect as well as whether or not physical therapy was even a real ‚Äúhelp or treatment‚Äù. Within a little over a week, I went from complete NON bearing weight to standing on both legs. I go 3 days  per week ad each week I am blown away at how much I improve. The ladies at the front desk are a pure delight and all 3 therapists I have worked with (Laura Beth, Lauren & Dan) treat me with such care and concern. They immediately pick up when I‚Äôm having a bad or painful day and have helped so much that I could never truly express my thanks. The entire staff is fun and always cheerful (even though I am late almost every visit). I couldn‚Äôt imagine going anywhere else! Thank you so much!!!"
"I have been coming to PT Solutions for just over a month now and I am beyond impressed with the staff and my recovery. I have been to other physical therapy offices and no other office has given me this type of relief, especially this rapidly. Everyone that works here is very friendly and knows how to treat the human body. I came in with a shoulder injury and they did only help alleviate all my shoulder pain but they did it extremely quickly. There was even an instance where I came in with tight hips and we worked on hip mobility. 20 minutes later my hips felt great. There isn't a muscular or structural problem they can't fix. Daniel worked on me for the most part. He is very personable."
"Everyone is very helpful, courteous, and kind.  The therapists are extremely good and adapt all sorts of methods to strengthen the areas where I need help.  I have improved a lot thanks to them."
"I picked this place because it was close to my home in Sandy Springs. I have gone to PT a few times in the past and I must say it was kind of like going to a doctors appointment, not necessarily pleasant but necessary. My experience with Dan at PT solutions was 100% different. Not only was his enthusiasm and commitment evident but I found myself looking forward to my sessions. The folks at this PT office are real professionals and fun to work with. Bonus , they fixed my neck problem. Highly recommend this office and Dan and Lauren in particular."
I love PT Solutions Sandy Springs. Carolyn at the front desk is always so welcoming and the therapists are top notch. Dry needing is a must...
"PT solutions sandy springs has been one of my biggest blessings in 2020.  The staff there are wonderful, they have great teamwork, scheduling is easy and they offer text message for rescheduling if needed. Lauren, Laura Beth, and Dan are wonderful. All three therapists have helped me to overcome many years of poor posture, lack of abdominal strength, hyper mobility, unstable shoulder, weakness, and pain.   I would highly recommend them.  Parking is great, and they are always running on time."
"I have been so impressed with PT Solutions. The therapists are knowledgeable and listen to any concerns. They have really helped me understand the steps I need to take to make a complete recovery from my injury. They challenge me and keep me motivated!  Everyone is friendly and encouraging. I would highly recommend PT Solutions, Sandy Springs."
"Dan Vapne gave me my life back! My problems were daily and debilitating and I felt like they could never get better. After just a few weeks, I was off all of my strong pain medicines and had no more pain! It was amazing! He is encouraging, knowledgeable, makes each appointment fun, and really cares. He is the best!!!"
"I‚Äôm back after a year of no PT and it‚Äôs great to be back. The workers welcomed me with big arms, im now motivated to get healthier! I can‚Äôt wait to see the progress!"
"Everyone at PT Solutions is professional and caring, but most importantly incredibly knowledgeable.  The atmosphere is uplifting and encouraging.    ALL the the therapists care about ALL the patients.  Laura Beth you are my Angel!"
"I was a bit hesitant to start physical therapy in the first place, however my physician was sure it would help. I didn‚Äôt believe it would work however Dr. Dan got my results with my Achilles Tendonitis within the first week and now i can walk without symptoms. He‚Äôs so patient and explains each aspect of the treatment. I wish he was my wife!  :)"
"I could not be more pleased with the team at PT Solutions  Sandy Springs and the results I am seeing.  From the check-in to the therapy they are top notch.  They are ultra focused on adhering to the latest Covid protocols and you feel absolutely safe while visiting.  I went to PT Solutions as follow-up to my rotator cuff surgery and while I am getting that addressed, they are also helping me with my chronic headaches and vertigo.  The Therapist team of Laura Beth, Lauren, and Daniel are all excellent!"
Laura Beth and the entire team is top notch. Very thorough and friendly. Highly recommend.
"Very nice people.  Knowledgeable and effective
Highly recommend"
Dan at PT Solutions has treated me the past year and its the best thing to happen to me. I am able to keep up with my wife no longer wake up with pain in my feet and my back. He has addressed my scoliosis and now I feel taller than years before. I can not say enough good things about Dan and the PTS team.
"Dan rocks, Carolyn and Thianne are super helpful and Lauren‚Äôs got a great laugh"
"I was so anxious to start physical therapy, but the team at PTSolutions Sandy Springs were so helpful after my shoulder surgery. Dan was extremely helpful and knowledgable and spanish speaking accomadating. It is a pleasure doing my rehab here and I couldn't think of a better place to go. Go here if you want to get well!"
Everyone I worked with were so great! they were able to figure out my issue and write up a plan to get me back to normal! I would highly recommend PT Solutions!
They are amazing! They go the extra mile to make sure your taken care of.
"Update: At my last appointment, my PT worked with me on a plan to continue strengthening my knee at home. I followed the plan and was able to achieve my goal of skiing last week. Lauren, Laura Beth and Dan are the best!

---------
Original Post:

I have been going for about 3 weeks to rehab my knee after a skiing accident. Everyone there is friendly and professional, and they have really helped me recover my range of motion and to build up strength. In addition to the work we do in our sessions, they have created home exercise plans complete with videos. I look forward to my sessions, and I feel pretty confident that they are going to allow me to avoid surgery."
Great friendly environment and I have seen a lot of improvement in a short period of time after I had ankle surgery.
"I have had chronic lower back pain for a few years and a couple months with Daniel at PT Solutions helped eliminate it. He was very flexible with appointments, always friendly (as was the rest of the staff), and thorough in explaining things."
"Daniel is AMAZING!!!!

I highly recommend this place!"
I have been to so many PT clinics and this clinic is my favorite! All of the Physical Therapists are not only so friendly but are also so helpful.
"Horrible experience. First, it took several weeks to get the approval for the initial evaluation and to start his treatment. Second, about 4 weeks ago the front desk Carolyne and Dr. Daniel told me on the phone that the insurance denied more visits for my son because ‚Äúthere was no funding‚Äù?! I asked them to do an appeal but they have not to this day. I spoke with insurance and they said that PT Solutions didn‚Äôt submit enough information, notes and documentation to support why my son needed treatment, neither they submitted an appeal after the denial. Let alone the lack or courtesy and care from Dr. Laura Brown, to the point where she denied to see him for his last scheduled visit with her when we were already there because according to her she was too busy, but yet while a different Dr. we didn‚Äôt know treated him, she was cleaning the treatment tables and talking around with her colleagues. We never felt welcome by Brown, but now I know that she is discriminatory and biased against my son and I. They failed to do the right thing, to submit what they knew was necessary for my son to continue his necessary treatment, and by this, they interrupted his healing and violate his right to receive treatment even going against his orthopedic Dr. recommendations."
Daniel Vapne is the best PT! He saved my knee and he is very professional.Thank you so much Daniel for making me healthy again!
"My son was a client of PT Solutions Sandy Spring last year. He was extremely pleased with his therapy and rated them with 5-Stars.

I am 84 years of age and recovering from left hip replacement surgery. Currently, I have come to PT three times a week for two weeks. I concur exactly with my son‚Äôs recommendation.

All, and I mean all, of the Therprist are competent, professional and enthusiastic about their profession. I am more than pleased with my treatment plan and the tasks I am working on.

I recommend this facility and the healthcare team therein without reservations.

William L May Jr"
Best care in the area! Front desk is attentive and courteous. Therapist are knowledgeable and engaging
What a great team of professional and talented people!! Thanks for helping me do better and feel better !
Excellent service and very knowledgeable staff with a convenient location. PT Solutions did a great job on my wife's shoulder after rotator cuff/bone spur surgery a year or two ago and she highly recommended that I use their services. I am a very satisfied customer!
Working with the front office staff at the PT Solutions in Sandy Spring has been so easy both with scheduling and billing.  Natalia has also been an excellent physical therapist.  She has made the entire experience informative and helpful leaving me feeling empowered and motivated in my healing journey!
"These folks are the best, I walked in a little leery having never done physical therapy but Dan and the team have given me hope and confidence that I will recover üòä"
Love this place!
"We had a terrific experience at PT Solutions, Sandy Springs. Justin, our PT, was exemplary. He was professional, knowledgeable and skilled. His pleasant demeanor was an added plus. The facility was convenient and immaculate. All of the staff was very courteous and interactive with the patients. Obviously, we were very pleased and if the need should occur, they will be our Physical Therapy center of choice. They will be yours too!
As an aside, as a retired physician, I feel I am a well qualified observer!!!

To upgrade my previous 5 star review, we have continued physical therapy for my wife. Since Justin is no longer at this facility,  Laura Beth has continued the same excellent management of my wife‚Äôs care. She is professional, personable and knowledgeable. Brendt, her assistant, complements Lara Beth‚Äôs treatment very nicely. PT Solutions is a professional and comfortable environment. Patients are very much at ease and made to feel very special by all of the staff. They set a standard by which all Physical Therapy should be measured!"
"Efficient kind know what they are doing. I have gone from being unable to sit to being able to sit and walk and exercise in 10 days.
Thanks so much."
"Wonderful and capable staff, special hours for required mask use."
"I have found the physical therapists at PT Solutions to be knowledgeable, practical and very helpful in their treatment of patients.  After just a few sessions I am greatly improved. The atmosphere there is relaxed and welcoming.  I highly recommend them!"
"Emily is an amasing physical therapist. She is knowledgeable, compassionate, professional and takes the time to understand my unique needs. Having an autoimmune disease, it's been a challenge working on my ankle and knee. Emily has been very patient and adjusted treatment as needed. Definitely recommend."
"PTS of Sandy Springs is a great facility, and my PT Dan is at the top of his game. I highly recommend."
"Great service and friendly staff makes the work more bearable. If you have to have PT, ths is the place to go! I should know with two knee replacements and 8 total knee surgeries..."
We are having our session with Daniel and He is super awesome. My mom loves him and he has made a noticeable change in her daily activities.
"I have been so pleased with my experience at this place.  Emily, my therapist, has been wonderful and I can already see improvements in my health and strength.  The facility is bright and well maintained and the personnel are kind and caring people."
"Beware of sharing your medical information with PT Solutions in Sandy Springs! They have been accidentally emailing me someone else's medical information for weeks. I've written them multiple times politely asking them to correct their database and find the correct email address for their client. Zero response thus far. They just keep sending me this poor client's emails. Most are harmless appointment reminders but some have contained confidential medical information. ***Edit 4.23.18 Now, in addition to the medical information they've started sending me this other person's financial information... ***"
"Great environment! Friendly patients, friendly therapists, and fun atmosphere."
"I recently went through physical therapy on my hamstring at PT solutions and had an amazing experience. All of the staff are extremely kind, respectful, accommodating, and knowledgeable. I worked mostly with Justin, Laura Beth, and Emily (hopefully I spelled everyone's names right) and they were all fantastic. I enjoyed jumping around between different therapists because they each had their own styles and I felt I was able to perform a larger variety of exercises this way. If you are living around the Sandy Springs area and you need physical therapy then I  highly recommend PT solutions. If you are on the fence, go in for a free consultation and you will be sold!"
They are wonderful! They really know what they're doing. It's a great environment and the staff are great. I recommend them highly if you need a Physical therapist. They are part of Well Stone Hospital.
My therapist Justin is very friendly and caring.  I am recovering from a very serious motor vehicle accident and he is helping me get back to work.  He explains what he is doing and why and is careful that it is not too much for me while not making me feel dumb.  :)
"I am 61 years old and have had back problems for 20 years. I have been to many Physicians, Hospitals etc.  David is the 1st person that has fixed multiple issues with my back in 20 years. He is a great listener and developed a plan that fixed my problems and  that I can complete at home. I also went to Justin who was trained by David and is also excellent! I would highly recommend PT Solutions to everyone!! Give them a 5 star!!"
Excellent therapists. Much better than other PT providers who seem to give every patient the same exercises.  Here they vary your treatment at almost every visit.    HIGHLY recommended.
"In all the physical therapy I've had over the years, this is by far the best therapy I've ever received. They are well trained and highly competent. I definitely recommend them!"
They are a terrific group.  Caring and actually make PT fun!
"I really appreciate PT Solutions - their professionalism, personal attention and intuitive understanding about how to solve my problem(s).  I will recommend to anyone  requiring physical therapy"
"Staff is great! Knowledgeable, professional and friendly.   I'm feeling so much better since I started and I'm learning so much about how to stay strong and on track!  I highly recommend PT Solutions."
"John Michael and the staff at PT Solutions are tremendous physical therapists who genuinely care about their patients!  With their help, I've successfully recovered from serious back and shoulder injuries. We're lucky to have them in the neighborhood and I highly recommend them!"
"I injured my rotator cuff to the point that had very limited range of motion with much pain.

Now after several weeks of therapy I have full range of motion with no pain.

Neil Armstrong may have walked on the moon but I believe Laura-Beth and her team hung it.

I have recommended another member of my family and she is equally favorably impressed.

Initially I did not think PT would help me - now I am a believer.

You cannot go wrong with PT Solutions.  And they will give you a free evaluation."
"PT and Justin are concentrated on cause as opposed to effect. Got some relief after 2 sessions, and lots of progress since then.
Update: postop hip surgery on February 19th and back to PT. Can‚Äôt begin to thank all the therapists involved in my postop PT. Knowledgeable, professional 10 stars!!!"
They are a great group of personnel at this offi e.  They are all very helpful.  In addition they run their facility on time...never a wait.
"I don't give 5 stars for anything, but these folks are close.  Friendly helpful staff and positive results!!!"
The staff are always friendly and very patience with my kids.  Love this place.  They do really care.
The entire staff at PT Solutions Sandy Springs are awesome.  They put together a comprehensive plan to help me recover from a sports injury.  Thank you Laura Beth and Elizabeth!!!
They are a great group of therapist that work with you to help strength your whole body
"Easy to get an appointment, never have to wait, very well run but - more than anything - they do excellent work.  Laura Beth is the only Physical Therapist I've ever had that doesn't just isolate focus one body part or one type of treatment."
Great experience with PT Solutions. Experienced and caring staff; no problem getting an appointment.
"My husband and I visited the office recently and were very pleased with the service that they provided us. LauraBeth Brown, Elizabeth Selman, and Le'Shaunda Jones were all very professional and nice. I highly recommend them!"
Nice and clean office. Staff friendly and professional
"Paul and Justin are fabulous, great location, 10/10 would recommend"
"This was much more help than I expected for the first Free Injury screening.No pressure, lots of support from entire staff. My Doc was right about the high recommendation."
"Laurabeth has helped immensely with strengthening my shoulder, as well as pain management."
























"Very disappointed. I‚Äôm a huge advocate for anything Emory. However, they are understaffed with certified PTs. They have helpers but the helpers/trainees (although very sweet) can‚Äôt make any decisions without the certified PT. Which I completely understand. Problem is they typically only have one certified PT in the area and I typically saw 8 patients. So that‚Äôs one PT to 8 patients. She was spread to thin. Her lack of concentration while trying to voice your concerns or talk to her was extremely difficult. She would never remember what you told her from one visit to the next which led me to believe she either didn‚Äôt take notes or she didn‚Äôt read her notes. I could list each issue I had concerning that but it would be a long list. I finally had to switch to another Pt‚Ä¶Back in the Game Physical Therapy who are outstanding. They wouldn‚Äôt leave me sitting there for 10 minutes between exercises waiting for instructions. I was in and out in an hour unlike Emory where I got little attention. I would be there for easily 2 hours and feel like I walked out without therapy and lack of communication."
Excellent staff. Physical therapist Kate is great. She wI'll work on your pain to go away gradually!
"Excellent physical therapists that truly know how to get their patients back in the game.  I appreciate the care,  concern and attention to detail.  The later hours and schedule are a definite plus."

I just finished up working with Pt Solutions of Wade Green with a 3 month stint in working with Anel on building up strength in both knees to help with the arthritic knee pain I was experiencing. He was always attentive and very knowledgeable in explaining what needed to take place to make things better.  He was able to push me into doing things I never though I could do and was always encouraging and supportive.  I am not a 100% but definitely better than when I started and know what I need to do on my own to keep things moving in the right direction.  I loved going and wish everyone at PT solutions all the best!
"It would be great if I could afford to have Anel, Chase, and the remainder of the staff to be my personal rehab therapists. My first time ever at physical therapy was after my second back surgery. They were kind, very personable, attentive to my needs, and just pushy enough to get me moving in the right direction with my recovery.
My improvement was more than I expected during my time there. I really appreciate all the work they put into seeing that I worked myself to gain  strength and mobility.

I will definitely refer any of my friends and family to PT Solutions of Wade Green.
Thank you and I wish you all well.
RB"
"This was my first time at PT Solutions.  I came here after my second ankle surgery within a year. Throughout my 10 weeks there, I was treated with such professionalism, kindness, and care.  The therapists are clearly knowledgeable and provided me with treatment that was specifically designed for my recovery and what I was capable of doing throughout my treatment.  It was evident that the staff truly cared about my well-being and worked hard to get me back to 100%.  At PT Solutions, you don't feel like just another patient.  Everyone who works here works as  a team and has so much dedication and commitment to their patients.  They are remarkable, and I am thankful that I put my care in their hands."
"Great therapists, excellent facility.  Friendly and competent."
"First time to experience professional physical therapy. Firstly, and most importantly, they fixed my problem, and very quickly. Service was very professional, courteous, and complete. Highly recommended."
The therapists listen to your concerns and develop an appropriate regimen. They are in contact with your referring physician so we are all on the same page. I feel I am being well taken care of.
This PT Solutions is the best! I really enjoyed going because of how friendly and caring the whole team was. It felt less like work and more like going to the gym with friends. Anel was super knowledgeable and always had great solutions each session for my whiplash stemming from a car accident. I‚Äôd highly recommend this clinic to anyone who needs focused and compassionate care in recovering from any injury.
"This clinic is awesome. Anel, the lead therapist has a specialization in orthopedics and is extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of therapy. The employees are very friendly and fun to be around when receiving therapy. I loved the environment and atmosphere. Also I loved the large dynamic of fellow customers that would  be in the clinic. I made a lot of friends there, I highly recommend this clinic."
I struggled with another Therapist.  My wife referred me to the team at PT Solutions Wade Green.  Probably the smartest thing I ever have done.  Rehab is never easy but the team and skills at PT Wade Green has me light years ahead of where I believed I would get after the first few weeks after a Total knee replacement.  Every aspect of this locations is 5 star quality and highly reccomended.
"I've been bring my 12 year old daughter for 4 months following a gymnastics back injury. All the staff are wonderful, friendly and accommodating. Appointments are easy to schedule and they are open a variety of hours for morning or evening hours. My daughter is stronger than she was before and knows what to work on to make sure her injury doesn't reoccur. They've really been great and I would highly recommend them;"
"Thank you to Anel, Alicia  and the rest of the staff for providing me excellent physical therapy. I do not use a cane anymore, my balance is MUCH better, and I am able to work longer outside with all my plants(a love of mine). I truly think this is the best physical therapy group there is!"
"I was referred to PT Solutions by a mutual friend.  Being that they were close to my house (and not knowing what to expect), I decided to give them a try.

Wow.   What a team.   I love these guys at the Wade Green location.    They work very well together, and I actually look forward to my scheduled sessions.

Anel is a fantastic therapist.  He knows is stuff and knows exactly what to do to achieve optimal results.   Lauren & Jenny are great as well.   They are very accommodating even to the point of playing the favorite tunes of their clients over their sound system!

The facility itself is very well designed.  Highly functional.

I heartily recommend PT Solutions without reservation!"
"I am very impressed by PT Solutions, the therapist Anel and all the office staff.  I was a patient there for 4 months while recovering from a fractured knee.  This office is very professional, everyone is friendly, they run on time and they make sure you have a pleasant session.  The PT is a fantastic encourager and has a unique ability to help you take the next step in your recovery.  I would highly recommend this practice."
"Anel  and the staff were exceptional!
I always walked in feeling welcomed and attentive to all of my needs.
I would highly recommend to anyone in need of physical therapy.
I feel sad , not seeing them on a regular basis anymore."
The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Very comfortable non intimidating environment.  I‚Äôd definitely recommend the Wade Green location to my family and friends.
"I've always had a great experience with PT Solutions. This is my first time using this location and I'm very glad that I did. Great location, flexible hours, and excellent therapy. Anel knew what to do to get me running painlessly again and encouraged me through the protocols. The result is that I am running without pain."
"Great place! Clean, friendly, and knowledgeable! My needs were tended to in a manner that made sense to me. My therapist, Anel, took the time to explain what was going on and what I could do in the clinic but also at home, on my time. Don't want to get hurt again but if I do... I know where to go! Thanks a ton!"
"Excellent staff and treatment plan.
Highly recommend PT Solutions."
When I first started I was nervous. But they were very professional and nice people. Thank you for your help and now I'm pain free!
"I chose PT Solutions because it was close to where I work. They were very flexible with the appointment times I needed. Anel is very knowledgeable and professional. The Wade Green location team works very well together. I looked forward to my appointments and everyone there encouraged me to push myself. I asked a lot of questions about why I was doing these exercises, how will this benefit me personally, and Anel always had a personalized answer for me. I am so thankful, I can go back to my regular activities without pain and now I understand what I need to do to stay strong."
"Great Location, very knowledgeable and personable staff. Found them to be very effective. I enjoyed my sessions with the team and more importantly, I got results!"
Great staff and great physical therapy.  Each session is always fun while working out. I really do enjoy working out with them.
The employees are amazing and make an effort to bond and really get to know you. Amazing place and they take great care of you.
Very helpful and very understanding. Just having someone to talk to who can truly understand your back pain and help you move in a healthy direction relieves a lot of the stress associated with physical pain.
Each and every person on staff is warm and inviting. During my recovery process from my acl surgery I was treated with the utmost respect and care. A family away from home.
"From the moment I started at PT solutions I felt so welcomed by the entire staff. Anel is incredibly knowledgable about his work and was willing to help me in every way possible. I attended therapy here for my second ACL reconstruction and was amazed by the progress I made in such little time. I dreaded going through this surgery again because of the long recovery it took me years ago, but I made extreme progress quickly and was able to return to my everyday activities in no time. I owe my speedy recovery to Anel and the whole PT solutions staff and I highly recommend them for all of your therapy needs."
Fantastic staff and facility.  I would definitely recommend PT Solutions Wade Green to family and friends.
"Anel has been such a blessing and has been a great PT... his experience and expertise has been so appreciated and I am so thankful to have been referred here.. the staff Grant, Taylor, and Lauren have been beyond helpful through my entire experience..."
"Friendly, personable and dedicated! New, clean and convenient facility. Highly recommend these amazing people at this great place!!"
"Anel Durmisevic and PT Solutions changed my life. After years of lower back pain, I was referred to PT Solutions, and I am so thankful. I cannot say enough good things about Anel, his expertise, and his dedication to his patients. The practice as a whole is phenomenal, and their PTs and staff are absolutely the best in the field."
Great people and even better physical therapy!!  Wouldn't be able to do the things I do today without them!






"Monica is the BEST. After SLAP surgery on my left shoulder, I found ATI and Monica. Together they provide the BEST REHAB THERAPY which is convenient, clean, and staffed with PROFESSIONALS. THANKS MONICA and ATI!!!!!"
I Recently started going to ATI after having surgery and I am beyond impressed at the professionalism and care Anna provides. She called my doctors office to make sure she had the right plan of action before I even went to see her. She provides great care every visit and is genuinely interested in my recovery. I know I‚Äôm in good hands.
I am a 67 year old woman. Within the past 5 years I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and I had 2 back surgeries. I came to ATI to request help with my balance and gait. I also desperately needed to improve my upper and lower body strength so that I could perform basic daily living tasks and normal day to day activities that most people take for granted. Even though I wasn‚Äôt that optimistic that Physical Therapy would be if any help for me I  decided to give ATI a call just for information anyway. I figured I had nothing to lose. So I called and spoke to a very knowledgeable young man named Michael. He was able to answer all my questions easily and schedule my first visit. On my first visit Michael greeted me at the front desk and made me feel comfortable. He introduced me to Anna Snider who is an amazing Physical Therapist. Anna is very knowledgeable and compassionate.  She is very gifted in her ability to challenge and motivate her patients. The results of her superior knowledge and skill set are so evident in the progress I have made in just a few short weeks. My balance and gait has improved so much that I am able to walk independently without the fear of falling. I am also able to do more household chores and take walks with my husband again. My husband is ecstatic about all the improvements that he notices since I started physical therapy at ATI. What a positive difference ATI has made in my quality of life!  Thanks to Anna and Michael.
The team at this location is awesome! I've had other therapist in the past. Tanner is among the best!
Wonderful staff. They are very patient and take their time during appointments. I never felt rushed and Christopher was very knowledgeable and demonstrated each exercise. Awesome place.
"The best place ever, I‚Äôve had terrible back pain for years, had spinal blocks done and nothing has given me relief. Thank goodness for PT Solutions, Chris and Tanner are amazing. Chris started acupuncture this week and for the first time in years I have hardly any pain in my back. I feel wonderful I can move again. Best experience ever."
"This place (so far) is OUTSTANDING. They‚Äôre all kind, respectful, understanding, helpful and you can feel they actually care. We have had to reschedule and they didn‚Äôt make an issue about it. Morgan at the front desk is absolutely wonderful to work with and Tanner the physical therapist took the time to go over everything and made sure my husband understood everything he would be going through and how to handle it. He was knowledgeable and fun to talk to. EXCELLENT place for sure."
This place is AWESOME! Morgan is always pleasant and greets you with smile. Deitra is the best therapist I ever had. I have had quite a few. The one on one and the advice and the personal care that she gives is amazing. They are a great team and they care about each and every person that walks in the door. They are the BEST!
"This place is amazing Morgan at the front desk is the sweetest and Tanner is the best therapist around he is amazing the whole place is great they really do care about all of their patients Tanner is helped me, along way in my walking again journey"
"Great staff, very thorough with pre-screen assessments and attention to detail specifics during the physical therapy sessions! Highly recommend!!!"
"Friendly caring staff, great modern facility and provide excellent care."
"Great place all the way around. The staff is friendly and helpful. I‚Äôm 5 weeks post total knee replacement and my doctor told me that she would have guessed I was 6 months post surgery because of my range of motion and strength with the joint.

Tony, Tia, and Mia are all there to help. They don‚Äôt have a fake friendliness that you can get at some places. They genuinely want you to get better and like what they do."
"Entered rehabilitation physical therapy after breaking my leg in an accident. From the time I called to make an appointment, the staff was friendly and made it an easy process. I have been doing physical therapy for 7 weeks with Tony. He really pays attention to detail and takes his time with each patient. I am very happy with my progress. I would definitely recommend going here!"
"Had an amazing experience with this facility. Loved the staff. Very friendly and encouraging. Derek the physical therapist I had was fantastic! Very caring, encouraging and hard working through my treatment. I have learned so much about how to help myself with my specific issue. I got my life back and would recommend this PT and facility to anyone who was looking."
"If I can give them NO stars, I would. I was trying to make an appointment in person. They never opened. Sign on door said that they were at lunch. I stop by before lunch and after lunch and there were still close. Website does not have any hours of operations. Went ahead and left a message. They ended up calling me next business day and they lied to me saying that they were open but closed at a certain time. I informed the young lady that I was there during business hours and they were still closed. I was going to be a self paid patient they lost my business. Bottom line is that their hours of operation does not fit anyone that works. Really disappointed because they're such in a great location."
Matt and Josh are wonderful and caring gentlemen. Matt has the perfect demeanor for a physical therapist. He has helped go from being in a wheelchair to walking and regaining normalcy in my life. I highly recommend them!
The first time I went over there they were able to analyze all of the issues I was experiencing. From there they were able to take care of me. I was impressed that they were able to relieve the pain with just their hands and pressing on certain pressure points. They were also very friendly and showed that they genuinely cared.
Loved it here! Tony and Tia are great at what they do and I enjoyed every minute in therapy! My injury improved 100%
The staff is amazing and make you feel like family. The office is clean and very well taken care of.
Great clinic! Matt and the staff were very pleasant and knowledgeable.
"The staff was very caring,kind, and efficient"
Tony is great








"I love this rehabilitation/physical therapy center. I think Jodi is really nice. I just feel like sometimes there are too many people scheduled around the same time which takes away from each patient. I always feel like my therapy is being rushed through. It‚Äôs only a hour and I get that but I always feel like my hands on part of the therapy is rushed. Overall I love the place, Jodi is really nice, and I always look forward to my next appointment with Jodi."
I'm very impressed with the knowledge and care that I have received from Glenda.  She always has a wonderful smile on her face which makes you feel relaxed and comfortable. Will definitely recommend this business to others.

"From the first day I went for my appointment and couldn‚Äôt find the location on time, the front desk assistant was very helpful on the phone with finding the location. After arriving, I was greeted with a smile and felt instant welcomed to this place: My therapy is Kelly and she is a very warm and understanding person. With me being hearing impaired, she made sure I understood everything she was doing. And with the masks making it harder for me to understand, she switched hers for a clear face mask. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better therapist or location.Thank you Kelly."
Ms. Glendora is very professional and she cares about her clients!!

"Anna Brown is an exceptionally talented, gracious, and personable physical therapist.I am  a Family Practice M D with more than 38 years of experience and I have never seen anyone provide the level of treatment she performs on a daily basis to help patients return to such a high level of function.

The receptionist, Neeoka, is equally helpful, kind, and courteous.
Their work is outstanding.
It is an honor to be working with them."

"The entire team was great! They encouraged me and uplifted me throughout my healing process. I have tried other physical therapy locations in the past and struggled with the process, however, with BenchMark I increasingly achieved better results! Abby you are the best!!"
This place is awesome and wonderful staff. Abby and Sarah really helped my recovery from my accident and everything was always Covid 19 protected and that was a plus for me. Really great energy and exercises  that I am able to still do at home. Thanks for all your help. Great location and business.
"Abby at Benchmark is BOMB hands down!! She was patient and accommodating to the crazy schedule I have. She's also extremely personable and very good at what she does. I am feeling much better and I'm sure, with time, I will be back to 100%. I hope I never have to go back to Benchmark, but if I do, I would request Abby by name. Be sure to ask her about the girl that had ice in her sports bra lol, she'll know exactly who you're talking about lol."

"Pretty happy with the results. I strongly recommend PT solutions to everybody who has a need for physical therapy. The team at PT Solutions are very knowledgeable, they will help you to make you strong and happy again. They also very friendly."
"PT Solutions of Stone Mountain is the BEST place to go for PT! Spencer and his team are a joy to work with. Spencer spent time getting to know me as a person, helped me set goals and probably got more excited when I started achieving my goals than I did. The support he has for his patients makes the environment incredible. Nate on the office side is super knowledgeable and was able to answer any question I had in regards to my insurance. If you want a place that treats you like family and not just a patient, PT Solutions of Stone Mountain is the place for you!"
Awesome experience working with PT Solutions. Spencer was amazing at explaining the research behind his interventions and crafted a realistic and personalized plan that grew with my ability as I healed. The whole staff is fun to be around and they're diligent about cleanliness. Highly recommend!
"The staff at this location is by far the most professional and skillful physical therapists I have encountered. I have made more successful progress at this office than any other. David, Spencer, and Nate are truly awesome."
"Spencer is an awesome physical therapist & communicates with my physician & his staff regularly to ensure I have the best treatment plan.  Nate at the front desk is a joy to speak with each visit & David too!  Such a professional, fun & caring team!"
Everyone here his extremely nice from the staff to the other patients. Since 8th grade when I had my first knee dislocation my knee has never came to as close as good as my knee felt after only the first day. If you want actual results and want to feel that hope of getting better I highly recommend.
"Front desk staff (Nate) was extremely helpful, friendly, and up-front about my insurance and costs. The space is bright, clean, and inviting and the physical therapists were knowledgeable and enthusiastic."
"I have had pain in my shoulder from overutilization of the rhomboid while cycling.  I had pain in my knee from low stability strength, causing me to have ""knock knees.""  My PT rectified both of the problems at PT Solutions.  Spencer was able to diagnose, explain the why, treat, and then heal.  I am overly pleased with the level of skill my PT had."
"For all you do, for who you are, I will be forever  for the services l'm receiving from PT SOLUTIONS! Words cannot express my feelings, nor my thanks for all your help.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour thoughtfulness will always be remembered.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour help has been invaluable to me, and I don't know how I would managed without the team at PT SOLUTIONS!!!"
I love this place and the people who work there. It‚Äôs bright and open. I‚Äôm guided along the path designed just for me. I feel confident that I‚Äôll reach my goals.

Great experiences at PT Solutions! The entire staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The physical therapists are outstanding - very knowledgeable and very detailed in what they have you do. They truly care.
They are about healing your problems and very respectful. I enjoyed them very much.
"After having allot of bad experiences at other places, I came in with a less than positive view of physical therapy, but PT Solutions of Stone Mountain, changed my outlook on PT for the better."
"The Best people in üåç. From work ethic to personality,."
I was sent to PT Solutions by my pain management doctor. From the first moment I entered the clinic I was greeted by warm smiling faces. The staff was helpful and what I appreciated the most was the fact that the therapist was thorough and caring. He took the time necessary to evaluate my condition and offered exercises that fit my level of pain. I would highly recommend the PT Solutions staff to anyone looking for high quality physical therapy care. They are the best. This is the first time I have ever made a recommendation and I am glad to say thanks to Israel and the rest of the PT Solutions staff.
"Lauren and the team are fantastic.  The PT was challenging, and I know everyone at PT Solutions had my best interests at heart to get me to return to running as quickly as possible.  Kayla was always friendly from the minute I walked in the door!  Everyone was so positive! I‚Äôd recommend to anyone."
"Top notch physical therapy close to home. Can‚Äôt say enough about the wonderful staff!! Obi always greets us with a smile and warm welcome. Lauren is not only very personable, getting to know me and my daughter, but incredibly knowledgeable and has been a huge help with her recovery. She makes PT fun for a teenager‚Äî no small task! They ensure that our visits are enjoyable and effective‚Äî a combo not often met in healthcare.
I would highly recommend this PT Solutions to anyone and everyone!"
Best therapist ever.

2.  Unclear charges on invoice

3. Office administrator cannot explain all charges on the invoice.

It would cost $62,400 per year if I continue to go to this place. BEWARE!"

"Great place for Rehab. Therapists and technician's are very good at what they do. A caring, friendly and clean environment. ü§ó"
"Thank you so much for your care. Because of you I had great experience at the ocean... I was able to catch a shark, without my physical therapy my arm would still be going numb and I would not have been able to reel it in. Thank you for that and so much more."
"Had me walking without a limp in two or  three sessions. Great people, well equipped. Years of pain replaced with pain free living again. Best thing I have ever done for my body. Did I say all the personnel are great!!! Thank you all!!  Bill Brooks"
Great physical therapist's to work withüòä! Everyone is very professional and courteous. I highly recommend them.
I‚Äôve never needed physical therapy before. But after I broke my wrist I began pt with these professionals. The atmosphere is wonderful!  They are well trained and really helped me. Everyone was friendly and made me comfortable.
"Ive had to go here 3 different times for different reasons. I absolutely recommend them to everyone who needs help. They are truly professional, compassionate, knowledgeable, caring. And they,keep,you busy with smiles and chatting that so you don‚Äôt realize how much you‚Äôre hurting. I love and am thankful for Meghan, who is my main helper. Emily is awesome as well. Sarah is so very helpful and beyond friendly. Ben was my first,official one to get me going. The staff up front are as well great. From the time you walk in to the time you leave is a trying time yet this group makes the time easier to deal with. Give them a chance. You will be happy you did. Thanks each of you.
Colleen Morris"
"Make sure, if you do not understand how you should be doing exercises, to ask them. Sometimes as professionals we all forget that we sometimes assume our clients or patients know more than they do. Fortunately, PT Solutions of Calhoun understood this when I told them I was confused as to what I should be doing with the rest of my body during an exercise and they explained fully what I should engage, feel, and get out the exercise. Thank you for understanding and dumbing down your exercises, but always remember to assume your clients know nothing about exercise and treat them as newbies from the beginning. Great service and caring employees. Thank you for helping me."
"Everyone in the office was very professional and caring. They made therapy enjoyable for my daughter while also helping her to improve. Everyone was such a pleasure to work with and if the need arises we will return to PT Solutions. Thank you Sean, Ben and Saul!"
Amazing location with a great staff that really cares about your wellness. The facility is clean and the environment is always fun!
I absolutely love this place!! They have been so patient and understanding with me. I would recommend them to anyone who needs to go!!!
"I love this place they are very nice and caring about u, and helping u in everyway to make sure u are better than u was when u came in."
Very great people who are amazing at their jobs. Have helped me to recover and I have actually enjoyed everything visit
Nicest group of people I‚Äôve ever met. First choice for any therapeutic needs
"The therapist are friendly,  professional, and knowledgeable. The receptionists are no less so.
I hate that I needed physical therapy but I'm glad to have been revered, by my doctor, to PT Solutions."
AMAZING!!!!!





Thank you everyone! Charlotte thank you. Mary thank you. To walk into physical therapy was nothing I wanted to do. But I must say everyone I met and spoke with are so caring. They made this feel like you were hanging out with a friend. These ladies know their stuff. God Bless each of you. I love all of you!
"Love the aquatic therapy Benchmark offers, especially Mary the aquatic physical therapist. She is very easy to talk to which helps a lot when doing exercises while in pain and she explains everything in detail. Normally I am not a fan of physical therapy because of my chronic pain but Mary has helped ease a lot of that pain by showing me exercises that offer the best relief. Stephanie at the front desk has always been very helpful and friendly and really helps accommodate my schedule."
"Just a quick review concerning Bench mark and your staff. My thanks to Mary my physiotherapist for all her help over the last 12 months. She has excelled in her care and I‚Äôve noticed this with everybody at the pool, she encourages us to discuss what are different problems are which helps us a lot and understanding our own problems, this has been a great help and a relief that we are not going through this alone. Again my extreme thanks for all the help from your staff and in  Particular Mary. Cannot thank you enough"
Benchmark physical therapy is a great way to recuperate from an automobile accident. I went with really strong discomfort in my lower back and in my left hip and shoulder and I have done phenomenally well. My physical therapists Kelli and Mary were great. I highly recommend benchmark especially the Dawsonville location as that is where I went for my physical therapy. Patti (Patricia) McLaughlin.
"I have used Benchmark on a few different occasions. They really care about you and get to know you on a personal level. I have had a few of the therapist, but Mary is my favorite. I highly recommend Benchmark."
"I'm almost 5 months post op from rotator cuff surgery. My therapist, Kellie, was instrumental in my rehab. She makes sure that you get the most from the exercises. Nick, Drew and Mary were also helpful. Thanks team!"
"On April 10th I fell in the kitchen and broke Humerus on my right arm. It was a serious injury. My wife went to Benchmark when she had her knees surgically repaired and Benchmark got her back to normal after each surgery.
I signed up at Benchmark to get my arm back to working order. My experience at Benchmark was really great. I was released by the Dr. on September 13. I must thank Kelly, Mary, Charlotte and Autumn for the care that I was given."
I had a great experience at this location doing physical therapy after suffering a broken calcaneus (heel) bone and having reconstructive surgery.  I did both in office physical therapy and dry needling with Charlotte Baird and aquatic/pool therapy with Mary Leppert.  They were the best!!!  They were both so caring and attentive to my needs and were a vital part in my overall recovery.  I would highly recommend both of these amazing ladies!!
"Our family has used this location two different times. Excellent service and care for the patients. Highly recommend to someone needing physical therapy. We will use them for any future physical therapy, as well."
"Many thanks to all the staff at Benchmark Dawsonville for helping me through my recovery from a broken foot. All of the staff are welcoming and kind and make you feel at home right away. I was privileged to work with Mary, Nick & Charlotte, but honestly believe every therapist there is excellent. I did my aquatic therapy with Mary, and all other therapy with Nick. They were compassionate, encouraging and helped keep me hopeful, positive and focused. They all work together so great for the best outcome for their patients. I don't think you can find a better team of therapists than this!"
"This was not my first visit to BenchMark Physical Therapy! Just as my other visits this experience only reinforced just how outstanding this location operates in all aspects of a patient physical return to full Heath and in my case, I was given a back with the pain removed and I again felt human! Some times one fails to understand how much team work can go a long way to make your time with this location a very pleasant experience! Foe myself it started with Stephanie who greats you with a nice smile and how are you doing, and have a nice day. Next I always was greeted by my Physical Therapist,   on time like all visits (Kellie Keeney) for all of my visits! There was another Physical Therapist that helped with one of m visits and I received the same outstanding attention! During my visits I watch the other personal at this location and you could see what an outstanding location this was and will continue to be so in the future!
Would I return again if the needs comes up , you bet I would.

"I just finished 3 1/2 months of PT for a broken patella with Nick B in Dawsonville. I am so very pleased with the entire experience. Nick is very knowledgeable, patient with my endless questions and even made me laugh on many visits. The rest of the staff is wonderful too!  PT is hard work and you get the encouragement and motivation you need here to succeed. I am very grateful a friend recommended this Benchmark location to me."
From start to finish my experience at BenchMark Physical Therapy in Dawsonville was fantastic. From the friendliness of the front desk staff to the exceptional care provided by the PT specialists everything exceeded my expectations. My primary specialist was Charlotte and I can‚Äôt say enough good things about her. She was extremely easy to work with and really knew the best course of treatment for my injury. After just a few short weeks my shoulder is healed and I‚Äôm completely pain free. Thanks to all the staff at BenchMark Physical Therapy. I would not even think about going anywhere else if I have a need for PT in the future.
My first experience with Physical Therapy at Benchmark was amazing. I can now walk without limping and can walk up and down steps. A lot of progress in just a few weeks thanks to Nick. Thank you.
I have been to physical therapy twice at this facility and it has been excellent! I have multiple sclerosis and they have helped me regain my ability to walk both times. Mary is very patient with me and always looking for my best therapy solutions. I highly recommend this group to anyone looking for physical therapy.
I just wanted to thank all of the staff for being so sweet and considerate. Especially Kellie Keeney!! She is very knowledgeable and helpful and I really appreciate her!
This is the best place to go for therapy. Amazing staff and facility. I was way ahead of my timeline and ability. Kelly is amazing!
I am a healthy male who needed to strengthen back and core muscles for unnamed future ventures. Under the watchful command of Kelly and staff I am on my way to the kind of success people can only dream about. Soon I'll be as strong as an adult silverback and I'll have Benchmark to thank for that. I would enthusiastically recommend their dry needling and scraping techniques for taught muscles after each session; Trust me you'll feel as relaxed Willie Nelson in Maui when they're done with you. From the moment you enter the door they will treat you like royalty and by the time you leave you'll want to run for President. Two thumbs way up.
"Just finished up therapy after having shoulder surgery and the staff was amazing.  I saw Mary regularly, but had interaction Kellie, Nick, Drew and Josh (Downtown Dawsonville location)."
"My therapist was Kelly, she is skilled, knowledgeable and caring. By working with her I was able to regain strength and mobility in my neck and arm In record time. I highly recommend Benchmark to anyone needing physical therapy."
I started going in September for a frozen shoulder. My therapist was Charlotte. I could not have asked for a better therapist! She gave 110% to get me back to where I needed to be! She was very professional! Would recommend her 100 times over!
What an excellent service here in Dawson County!!!!   Kelly was my therapist.  She was so attentive to me and my recovery.  I am back to full ROM with my shoulder.  Everyone in the office was very friendly and helpful.  I watched other therapist help there patients with the same courteous and respect that Kelly showed me. Great group of folks. S. Harris
"Great group of professionals. The whole staff is very caring and helpful. Mary is my therapist, She is awsome. Due neck problems that led to surgery and having no use of my left arm .Because of Mary's dedication to her work and patients,the muscles strength is slowly returning. Mary keeps you motivated and encouraged to do tasks to be successful. I would give a 10 if the scale was higher."
"Kelly has been a godsend to my recovery.  The entire staff are all wonderful.  They listen to you and develope a unique plan based on you which may include stretches and/or excersises such as weights or medicine balls.  You really cant go wrong with them.  If you want the new age stuff try acupuncture, if you need to start out with stretches and build up to other things, go for it.  They will have the perfect plan to get you started on the road to recovery."
"I have done physical therapy many times in the past but never with such an incredible staff like the Therapist at Benchmark in Dawsonville. Specifically my Physical Therapist, Charlotte, has been  absolutely incredible and helping me through some difficult health problems caused by several injuries. The entire staff at this location work well together & have been so knowledgeable and helpful. The assistants  working at the front desk for check-in and check out are always so pleasant and efficient.  The other physical therapist that I observe twice a week while doing my own physical therapy are very dedicated and helpful to their patients. I feel so fortunate to have been able to use Benchmark in  Dawsonville to recover and become whole again. What a great team!
Shelley Miller"
"Wanted to shout out to Mary at Benchmark. Thank you for your compassion and empathy, not just to us, but all you encounter. She is attentive to each patient, encouraging friendly. Thank you for all that you do."
Very professional and attentive staff. Got me back close to 100% and opened my eyes to new ways of stretching/exercises so that I can continue to prevent injuries and improve myself. Highly recommend.
"My recent visit was a disaster, the young guy assigned to me did not have much experience and told me he was not qualified to do some of the therapy I needed.

I did not go back after the initial evaluation because I did not feel comfortable with tech.

Now I am dealing with their false billing and it has become a real nightmare. I wish I had never went there in the first place."
"Awesome staff!  Mary, Austin and Cody was who I mainly got the pleasure of working with.  It met and blew away with how my recovery went and how much better shape I‚Äôm in now.  Thanks FLO!"
"I have been using Outpatient Physical Therapy at the Dawsonville, GA location for the past couple weeks.  Grey Haddon and his assistant are to be commended for their dedication and professional attitude.  When I am receiving treatment from my left hip replacement surgery, I feel they consider me the most important person at that time....sure makes me feel good.   They work me hard....giving me breaks as needed but none the less, very active. When the session is over, yes, I am very tired but I know the time was well.  I look forward to each session knowing that they will be with me the entire time.....please keep up the good work and thanks for all you have done for/with me in making me feel so much better."
Everyone is super nice . They have helped me tremendously before and after my shoulder surgery.
I have been working with Drew and Kelly.  They have been excellant in explaining the exercise before we do it and what results it will achieve.
I have been going to this facility since may 2018 after shoulder surgery . I cant give them enough credit for getting me through! I'm now back for another injury ! They are always there and ready to help !!!! Even as stubborn as I am ! Couldn't imagine my lifting life without them !!! My security blanket if you will !!!!
"Dr. Destiny Hebert is the Director. She is in Cumming & Dahlonega, GA.  My Neuro-Surgeon & my MTJ Dr. referred her. I had had lower back problems for 20 years. Destiny worked with me for 3 months, 3 times a week, 7 Years ago. Not one problem with my back since then. WOW!"
They have reached out to resolve my issues. Kudos to the local staff...
horrible do not go
great reviews




"I am highly recommending this clinic.  I came in with multiple issues and each was addressed with a comprehensive protocol and healing hands of the therapist Andrew Smith.  My issues are degenerative and cannot be reversed but Andrew was able to greatly reduce my pain as well as give me tools to work with on my own. The clinic staff (Daphne) is friendly, organized and professional.  The clinic atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable.  Andrew is extremely knowledgeable and focused on treatment while also allowing for great music and a bit of humor which makes the sessions much more tolerable. I feel very satisfied with my care and I never dreaded going. Thank you!"
"Andrew and his team at Benchmark are the BEST!
From my first call to Daphne, to my treatment with Andrew.  Everyone working there is professional, knowledgeable and very caring.  I‚Äôve always felt comfortable and welcomed!  Thank you all so much for taking excellent care of me!"
"I‚Äôve seen my mom through 2 knee surgeries ( currently a total knee replacement) and I‚Äôve never seen the level of service that she receives at Benchmark.  The attention is incredibly personalized and there is nothing cookie cutter about this place.  Andrew knows exactly what his patients need and treats them accordingly.  On days when my mom was frustrated he lifted her spirits by showing her what she‚Äôs capable of.  He truly cares.If and when we need PT again, we won‚Äôt go anywhere else."
"The staff is very knowledgeable as well as kind and motivated to assist in reaching goals in rehabilitation.
Hannah and Andrew as well as Daphne are all awesome and I appreciate that they make us feel like family."
"Excellent place very professional and has every thing that you need to heal from an accident, very pleasant workers who actually care and the really work for you üôè"
Exceptionally great service and super positive atmosphere! Really informative and helpful on what the issue was at hand!
I received the individual care that I needed on my hands due to carpal tunnel syndrome from Hannah Ikeler. She was truly amazing!
My Experience with benchMark physical therapy has been Awesome! The Employees are very helpful and kind.... Thanks to Ms. Hannah and Ms. Dalphane for the support through my time of healing...and also thanks to the Crew as well!
We had a wonderful experience. Everyone was welcoming and accommodating towards my grandmother.
"Highly skilled, professional staff.  I receive physical and occupational therapy biweekly.  I'm encouraged to succeed and reach maximum recovery potential."
I have been a patient at this facility multiple times. The staff here is amazing!  I tell everyone to come here because I know they will get the best treatment and results. The atmosphere makes everyone at ease.
"The staff are friendly and very helpful. Yele is an excellent therapist and knows his stuff. The office is clean, bright and inviting. There is a genuine concern for you rehabilitation and recovery. My experience here for the past three months has been phenomenal. I'm going to miss them as this is my second to last visit. Thank you Yele and Kim for you professionalism, awesome bedside manner and friendship. Keep up the good work as I feel you will. Season Greetings!"
"Loved Yele and Kim at the Benchmark Physical Therapy East in Douglasville.
Very caring, helpful, patient, knowledgeable, became like family, actually miss going to physical therapy.
JB"



"This location is terrific, and Ezra was extremely helpful. While PT is not fun, everyone in the office made things easy and enjoyable."
"I have had two experiences with Benchmark Hamilton Mill. Last year hip issues. I worked with Darla and the hip issue is gone. The plan worked. She is well educated and communicated on a level I could relate to. This year rotator cuff surgery and Brandon was my PT. He is respectful, professional and friendly.
I graduated today and am most grateful to the entire team. I really will miss everyone. This is a well oiled machine. I will continue to recommend BENCHMARK!"
"After finishing exercises, I feel great. The other location in dacula, I left the place in pain."
"A broken shoulder just as COVID19 struck! The staff not only got me back to myself, they were conscientious about making sure everyone felt safe and looked after.  I was impressed with the personal care and always felt valued as a patient.  Darla in particular was so kind!  I would not hesitate to recommend them!"
I've been here several times and I have to say everyone who works here is extremely nice and professional.  I would highly recommend them!  Merry Christmas to all of you!
"Darla is excellent!  She was very helpful to answer questions, provide education, and get me back on the tennis courts!"
"I have a chronic condition that has me requiring PT almost constantly. This team is fantastic. In addition to working with me in the clinic to strike that balance between pushing myself and overdoing it, they do a great job of teaching me what I can do on my own."




"I had a left knee replacement in November 2020. Dr. Agnes Kim was my Physical Therapist and she was outstanding! She really pushed hard to help me recover quickly. She knew the correct threshold to challenge me and I told her that ""it hurts so good"" -- knowing that she was doing the right things to assist me in getting full range of motion. After completing 3 months of therapy, I am very grateful for the expertise of Dr. Kim. She is a tremendous therapist and very devoted to the recovery of her patients!  I highly recommend Dr. Kim as well as the other therapists at this location!! True professionals and excellent care for patients!"
"Jessica,  Jasmine and Austin took excellent care of me during my PT sessions.  There's a constant sense of support and well-being with the goal of empowerment.

The staff is highly skilled, patient, conscientious and caring.  Each client receives specific exercises to get well.

I thoroughly enjoyed the PT sessions and recommend this location."
"I‚Äôve had the best experience here. Unfortunately I‚Äôve been a long time patient due to multiple injuries but Agnes makes every day a great day! She‚Äôs always so happy and positive, I couldn‚Äôt have possibly gotten a better physical therapist.
The entire staff is so friendly. Such a warm environment to work on recovery!"
Jessica and her team are very professional and caring.  The exercises I practice were effective and Jessica's neck massage was the best!.
"Jessica and her team are simply THE best.  Period.  I've had PT all over the U.S. After going to see Jessica following my second spinal fusion surgery, I will never go anywhere else.  Jessica is incredibly knowledgeable, dedicated, persistent and on top of all that, FUN!  My foot drop and back pain are gone thanks to her.  Now both my wife and I see her. Jess and her team have helped us through numerous injuries.  I don't know know what we'd do without Jessica and Benchmark."
"My experience with BenchMark was fantastic! Jessica was very skillful and friendly, as was the rest of the staff. I got excellent results through treatment, and would highly recommend this practice to anyone seeking physical therapy."
"When I first started at Benchmark Therapy Buckhead I could barely get out of bed in the morning due to back and hip pain. After twelve sessions, I feel like a different person. I am seventy years old and feel decades younger. The real credit goes to Agnes Kim, my therapist. She pushed me hard to get well. She is incredibly skilled at therapy. She is always enthusiastic and positive. I faithfully did the exercises at home.

Everyone at Buckhead Benchmark was friendly and professional. I cannot begin to list all the positive features about the facility, especially Agnes."
"I went to Benchmark PT with a wrist issue which resulted in my inability to apply direct pressure to my palm without pain and limited range of motion. This pain was persistent and prevented me from doing daily things such as using my hands to stand up, pushing down on things, and working out. I dealt with the discomfort for two months and then decided to give BenchMark PT a try. My first session with Jessica Higgins ended with her giving my forearm a massage and my wrist felt NEW. I was able for the first time to apply pressure to my palm and push off the table. I was shocked to say the least, I had almost full range of motion after the FIRST visit. I completed my 6th session today and my wrist is pretty much brand new. With some at home continued stretching using the instructions and videos Jessica provided me my wrist has made a full recovery and now I no longer have to avoid it at all costs! Thank you so much Jessica for the therapy. I highly recommend this PT to anyone. They have dedicated staff who explain things thoroughly and go the extra mile to make sure you make a full recovery."
"The staff here is top notch, but I cannot say enough about my therapist, Jess Higgins.  I think she is one of the smartest, kindest and most dedicated professionals I have ever met.  I went there for facial paralysis from a bad case of Bells palsy.  I'm talking day after day of zero function, zero movement, zero change for 5 months.   Jess used electrical stimulation to wake up the muscles of my face.  After a few weeks I did start to have some movement, just as she predicted, and it got better from there.  Thank you all at Benchmark Buckhead, and especially Jess."
The experience has been outstanding. It makes me want to injure myself to keep coming back. Jess has really helped me improve more than I could‚Äôve expected.
"Jess and the team at Benchmark PT Buckhead helped me work through recovery after knee surgery.  Over the course of about 8 weeks of therapy, I have regained 90% function of my knee and have been able to resume normal activities.  I credit Jess with helping me through the worst part of recovery which I appreciate greatly!"
"Excellent facility.  Friendly, very competent staff.  Agnes Kim is a delight to work with - highly professional, caring and helpful.  I got great results."
"Outstanding experience with Jess. Very professional, very through. The location was obsessed with cleanliness during this period. Extremely friendly staff."
"Fantastic team, fantastic results! Would recommend to anyone in need of physical therapy."
So great and thanks so much to all!
Jessica and her staff are the best around. They are extremely personal  and care for your recovery more than yourself at times. They take as many precautions as possible to prevent the spread of COVID and in my three month PT journey I never had any concerns about sanity of the facility. Would recommend this location to any and all seeking help with any physical discomfort!
"I very highly recommend this place. Great service and personalized care. My therapist was Jessica Higgins. She did a great job evaluating my neck/shoulder pain (from computer use and texting etc), setting goals and getting me started on stretches as well as ramping up to strengthening exercises.I really liked her expertise in myofascial release via dry needling. I can assure you no one knows that better than Jessica. Most importantly she will never recommend anything that is not supported by science. She cares for all in the clinic including her patients and staff. She gives individual attention to one and all and you don't feel like you are all alone. Care like that provided by Jessica and her team (some of their names I am blocking on) is rare and doesn't happen everywhere.
If you have any PT/rehab needs seeing Benchmark Physical at Buckhead and meeting with Jessica is a must."
"I cannot say enough great things about this physical therapy office. It really does feel like a family. Jessica at the front desk is always positive and knows my voice on the phone. She knows how to bring a smile to my face even if I had a bad day before coming in. Erin is my physical therapist and she knows how to help my shoulder get to where it needs to be. She is very encouraging and helps modify exercises so I'm not in unnecessary pain. She also always helps to accommodate if something comes up in my schedule. When she had to be out for a couple of weeks, physical therapists from different locations cane to help. I was so impressed because they were also wonderful! That was amazing because I didn't have to worry even though my regular therapist was out. Stephanie at the same location is also so nice but she is not my therapist. Her patients really seem to love her. I am very happy with my decision to come here and when I had surgery it was no question that I would come here for my post surgery therapy. Love them!"
"Stephanie is amazing!! She's extremely knowledgeable and very friendly. Stephanie has been incredible working on the shoulder and elbow issues.  The staff are on top everything, too!  I Never have to worry about scheduling or billing issues.  100% recommend Benchmark -- top quality PT and you'll also like the people, too."
"I've had the pleasure (i know, not what you'd typically think going to a rehab center) of going to this location twice. Erin is the BEST at what she does and has cured me when I thought there was no light at the end of the tunnel without surgery. I cannot say enough good things about her and the rest of the staff. If given the choice, choose this location!"
I had my first surgery in October and began physical therapy with Erin and my experience at this warm and welcoming facility was beyond amazing. When you first come through the door everyone greets you and is happy and ready to get you started. Erin my PT is extremely patient and she really knows what‚Äôs best for her clients. My recovery has been so smooth and her techniques have gotten me back up and running. The receptionist associates Jess and Kay are so sweet and on top of getting you scheduled ahead of time and in time frames that fit your time.  I love you benchmark Buckhead!! I recommend anyone looking for a physical therapist to head right over to benchmark Buckhead !!! You will thank me later!
Benchmark was great to work with as I recovered from an ankle injury.  This is the second time I have used this group. They are super friendly.  Each time they have provided physical therapy that solved my issue. They also provided exercises that I can do for the long term so I do not have a recurring problem.
Stephanie is so good at what she does. She is really good at adjusting to the needs of her patients and I was able to improve my condition drastically. I feel very comfortable at this facility and it is flexible with appointment times.
"Erin is the best physical therapist I‚Äôve ever had. She is thorough, truly cares about her patients, is sensitive to pain, but at the same time, fearless in the way a good PT needs to be. If you are considering where to go, this is the place. Also the front desk staff is so great -  always addressing patients by name, helping out when needed, and keeping the mood light... it‚Äôs really an awesome place if you find that you need PT (often not fun for most of us). I‚Äôve treated with Stephanie too while Erin was out on vacation, and she‚Äôs at the top of her game as well. You can‚Äôt go wrong here.

I‚Äôve been to other places for PT. Erin and the whole team at Benchmark in Buckhead, truiy are a cut above the rest."
I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better PT with Stephanie and the rest of the crew at Benchmark- Buckhead! Stephanie always listened to my concerns and gave me the best plan to get me to where I want to be! I recommend them to everyone!
Love this place. Stephanie has helped me gain strength and relief that I didn‚Äôt think was possible!
"I had low to no expectation for my physical therapy- i but I am now a true Benchmark believer.I have made wonderful progress and can now comfortabley  walk again. The staff is awesome- all so kind, knowledgeable and helpful-the absolute best!"
Dr. Erin Kent is one of the best PTs I‚Äôve ever had and has helped us get back to normal life by rehabilitating and caring for my wife. Thank you!
Professional and personable. Loved my experience here with Steph and would highly recommend.
"Great experience. Friendly staff, Stephanie‚Äôs awesome, and I always feel better leaving."
"Dr Grace Mollohan of Brookhaven Benchmark Physical Therapy has demonstrated to me her great breadth of knowledge of the functioning of the human body- how muscles,  nerves, bones -  are supposed to work in harmony together and how to guide their healing once I have gotten them out of kilter.  At different times, I have moved from continuous pain with hamstring strain, muscle pain in my neck and knee, even dizziness with vertigo to  my life now painfree and dizziness free under Dr Mollohan's exceptionally knowledgable and highly trained care. She has also guided me in core strengthing. I wish I could properly thank her for giving me back my life of free movement and enjoying my sports and daily life again. I know where I will go if ever I am injured in the future and that is a blessing. Lenore Field"
The staff is very friendly and professional! Not to mention I'm knowledgeable

"Such a warm & inviting facility. Strong team of physical therapists and other associates. They always knew how to address my pains and issues. Clay , David & Sarah are great!"
"Having to go for two different reasons, everyone was very knowledgeable, professional and certainly helpful in fulfilling the end result to feel good. I wouldn't go anywhere else.  Great team!...   (Clay)Tina Cook"
"Injured my hand and wrist in a fall. They did a thorough examination and gave me exercises to help improve my usage. My therapy was changed and updated as I improved, and updated for maintenance after I finished. It was only 6 weeks and I have returned to pre-injury status. Love the videos for the exercises they make it easy to use and you can see what it looks like so you don‚Äôt do them wrong. David was stellar!"
"Our experience was outstanding! From the check-in desk to the physical therapist, we could not have been more pleased with our experience and we would highly recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy. We will miss David and going there. Everyone was so professional and caring and our doctor was thrilled with the progress we made there."
"After serious shoulder surgery, I went to Benchmark on Dawsonville Hwy. Staff was wonderful, and my therapy helped me get back to 100%. I highly recommend Clay and David. Thanks."
The staff is amazing and extremely helpful.  Physical therapist are extremely educational and know exactly how to help you.
Clay and the team are fantastic. Always friendly and really knowledgeable! I have had to use them a few different times over the last couple years and they have always helped me get up and going. My wife has also used this location and had the same experience. Keep up the gray work!!
The best team to service your pain.  Highly recommended team of physical therapist.  Do not look any where else.  This is the place to go to get you back on your feet quickly.
"The staff are fabulous. Clay, David, Cameron and Mrs. Sarah all are very knowledgeable and caring. They have the best-in-class patient care and unparalleled customer service that I have ever experienced. As I said....Very knowledgeable and they talk to you explaining every step of the way what they are doing...they put the patient first above everything else.
I recommend anyone who needs physical therapy to see the folks at Benchmark Dawsonville Hwy Clinic."
The therapists  was very helpful. They made me feel better grrr
"This place is FANTASTIC!!!!!!!  I will only go to my primary to get a referral to go to these guys.  I know Clay's name is somewhere is the bible ‚Ä¶.right below God's name of course!  I went in there due to pulling something in my back(could barely walk, sit, or get in/out of vehicle).  3 sessions and I was healed!  I had had migraines for years.....Clay healed those up in about 3 sessions - no lie! I thought I had a heel spur or something much worse...could hardly walk on left heel. He healed that in about 3 sessions!  I will be going there for ever.  This place is a diamond in the rough and a hidden jewel in Gainesville!!  No pills needed - just go see Clay!  Just call sweet Sara, she'll get you right in and handle ins, everything.  Cameron is also a staff member there that helps out Clay and he is fabulous as well.  And oh yeah......David is another PT there as well that is pretty famous at healing people quickly from what I witnessed.   This office is a fabulous TEAM that works collaboratively in helping you reach your goal of no pain(with no meds) in just a few sessions!  I highly recommend them.  I hope I don't ever feel pain again, but if I do --  I'll being go to see Clay and the team at Benchmark Therapy-Dawsonville Hwy location."
I‚Äôve had a great experience with Clay and the staff at this Benchmark location. Very thankful for his help with my knee pain. Highly recommend....
Clay is very compassionate and empathetic towards his clients. Very down to earth and good at what he does. I recommend clay and benchmark to any one.
I recently had 5 sessions of physical therapy with Clay Hammons. He was great in his treatments with my pinched nerve in my back. He not only worked with me at the clinic but gave me ideas to do at home. I would HIGHLY recommend Clay Hammons as a physical therapist.
"Clay Hammons runs the best physical therapy group I have ever attended.  Being a senior citizen, I have been through numerous PT groups over the years.  I have to say Clay‚Äôs team (Clay, Sarah, Cameron, & David) all work together delightfully to treat the patients with dignity and compassion.  Their positive reinforcement and therapy approach helps to turn the patient‚Äôs affliction around to a healthy successful outcome.  They really care for the patient and focus on the best solutions for the patient‚Äôs well being to get a good recuperated result.  I won‚Äôt go anywhere else for PT.  My husband has also used this group.  He and I highly recommend this group above all others."
"Very positive experience following referral to Benchmark PT ,Dawsonville Hwy, Gainesville,Ga
Clay my primary PT and all staff were  caring, professional, friendly and encouraging resulting in a greatly improved outcome. Definitely recommend  this location."
Awesome staff!  Clay is an amazing physical therapist who really cares about his patients and goes above and beyond to help you.


"So the other reviews cover the basics, but a huge shout out to the 3 PTs. Elizabeth, Hailey, and Rachel were great to work with. The communication between the three of them to ensure continuity of care, and progress towards the ultimate goal of getting you back to living a fulfilling life is incredible. It's rare to go anywhere and not be just a number, and rarer still to have a team that cares as much as these ladies do. The effort they put into not only understanding the current condition, but they work to the understand and correct the root problem.
Sierra and Madison at the front desk were always a friendly smile when heading in and walking out. They made you feel truly welcomed and part of the family. While no one is ever excited to have to get ongoing care, the team here makes it a pleasant experience and you won't go wrong making them your preferred spot to go to."
"Excellent physical therapists!  Supportive and relaxed atmosphere.  Elizabeth, Haley, Rachel, and all the others enabled me to finally be able to resume all my normal physical activities without pain after bunion surgery on my foot.  I was actually sad that my therapy came to a close - I got used to seeing them twice a week!   Thank you!  I will definitely use them again if I ever need physical therapy!"
Everyone is so nice. They are amazing. They don't try to rush you through your therapy. They are willing to help you in any way. Thanks guys!
What an amazing experience!  I have seen three physical therapists at Benchmark in North Columbus and all were top-notch.   I am now healthier and stronger than I was 10 years ago and feel great.  I can exercise more regularly without pain than ever before.   They not only cured what hurt but also pointed me toward a healthier lifestyle that will last a lifetime.
"Outstanding rehab! ALL the people were caring, professional, (compassionate! lol) and very knowledgable about treatments. Schedules were flexible and easy to access. The online app made communication easy. Rachel, Ally, and Shelley made all aspects of therapy easy and effective.  The location offers a variety of treatment options, so you will find a program that works best for you. I got noticeably better each time I went. HIGHLY recommend Benchmark (Bradley Park) for any rehab or physical therapy!"
The ladies of BenchMark are AWESOME.  The professionalism is amazing.
"Very professional and friendly staff. They not only took care of my physical therapy needs, they treated me like family. I am moving and going again, after my surgery, thanks to them."

Excellent so far. Have had 3 of 15 sessions for back and hip issues. Initial evaluation was thorough with in between session exercises. The physical therapists know what they are doing.  Chronic pain is dropping.
"In 2 weeks I have better range of motion in my shoulder. I also have tools and exercises to work on at home to keep improving my mobility! Elisa and Dave have been gentle, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful! Even gently walked me through my first dry needling experience! Highly recommend."
"I selfishly hesitate to give a good review because I don‚Äôt want it to get crowded. Seriously though, this is my third time using this facility in the past ten years. I choose to go there even though other places are closer.
Staff is knowledgeable, pleasant to work with, and works my joints/muscles hard but not too hard. My recovery on each of the first two trips was timely.
I am very pleased with the treatment I receive."
I was serviced because of a broken index finger on my right hand. I had no range/ movement at all. I have a much better range now and am getting better daily.
"ATI professionals have shown me the utmost respect to me and for my fears with physical activity considering my disabilities. They've gone out of their way to conform a schedule to my liking and needs. They're willing to adjust anything as far as exercise repetitions or types of exercises if I don't feel comfortable and I haven't had that problem but I know it wouldn't be one. Very great people. A clean facility. I watched them clean after every table was used, every piece of equipment and they're all still wearing masks so it's a very safe, very pleasant experience.  thank you ATI and you're lovely staff."
I have been very impressed with the attention the staff gives to each patient. I had a little anxiety about the therapy because of my pain and lack of exercise. I have seen 3 different therapist so far and they have all been great. I actually look forward to going now because I'm convinced they are helping me.
Always a professional and pleasant facility. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. I look forward to going rather than dreading it!
"I love ATI so much. Elisa and David are the two people I have worked with the most and they are both so compassionate, friendly and knowledgeable. The whole staff at this location are always so pleasant. I really love it there and if I ever have any more issues that may need PT I will choose them first."
"I am very pleased with the excellent, care I received from the staff at ATI during my therapy. They were friendly, knowledgeable, and most attentive. I was guided through each therapy session carefully and thoughtfully, moving from one activity to another, in a sequence that made sense and was progressively challenging as I improved my skill.
Rebekah is an excellent manager. The staff followed her lead and professional example. There would be a room full of therapists and clients, yet the noise level was minimal. There was a definite air of purpose. Everyone was on task, focusing on their clients.
I would like to especially recognize Jack S. He continually observed my movements and made adjustments where necessary. However, he took the therapy a step further by explaining the why of his suggestions, and what muscle groups were impacted. I am most appreciative, as I was able to visualize and better feel the movements necessary which helped me improve quicker and with better understanding."
I‚Äôve worked with Nelson and Haley and there both excellent at what they do. I highly recommend this  office as they have inspired me and motivated me to heal and make great progress in being able to return back to work. Friendly & comfortable environment. 5 stars all day!!!!!
"Awesome Experience.  I had been going to a chiropractor for a while and had made no progress for a nerve issue.  After my first visit, I felt so much better. Two visits and plenty of exercises in, I am almost back to normal.  I am so thankful for this place and the dedicated individuals that work here.  I love you guys!"
Hayley has been a great help for me. She knows what she is doing and due to the fact I am making great progress. Definitely satisfied with the work she is providing. Also the ladies at the front desk are very welcoming and make it a very comfortable place to be a part of!
"The ATI PT staff is caring and considerate, especially for first timers. And they play some great music for your exercising enjoyment!"
"This review is from Darrell Goodwin, husband of June.  I‚Äôve only had 4 of 12 appointments, but so far am happy. The people have been, not only very friendly but very knowledgeable about what they do. Also this is the 2nd time I have been referred to ATI by different doctors. Of course no therapist can do it all for you. It‚Äôs up to you to do the necessary things to make your particular situation better. I gave 4 rather than 5 stars only because I still have 8 sessions to go. I do believe my satisfaction will be the same."
"I started therapy there last summer and wanted a physical therapist who would work me very hard and make me do everything the exact right way. I found that in Tristan. She challenges me and pushes me to do my best,  and always has an upbeat attitude."
Staff is very knowledgeable and professional. It has a very pleasant atmosphere in the room. They work the clients hard but are aware of well tolerated the exercises are by that client. Overall it is the nicest physical therapy center I've ever been in.
It is well run and friendly facility. The PTs and PTAs are very knowledgeable and congenial. ATI should be proud of the group.
I really like the Jack Sullivan‚Äôs encouragement and knowledge. His scheduling has been flexible in meeting my needs.
"I have had Tristan Mcclain for almost a year as my physical therapist. She is very thorough, knowledgably, and gently pushes her patients to do their absolute  best to achieve the best outcome possible."
Great service with a good group of people to work with all your physical therapy needs.
Great service! Very personable. I highly recommend ATI!
"Watch your statements!  Great Therapist but terrible accounting. When I began PT in early April 2020, I completed 15 sessions that were covered by my insurance.  Then when my 15 visits were up the lady at check out (Bobbi, at the time) said that any additional visits would be charged at the ""self-pay rate"" of $113.  The next front desk girl, Shannon even provided me with the agreement, which was signed on August 8, 2020.  I PAID the agreed amount that cleared our account on August 24, 2020. And we keep getting harassed with monthly statements that we owe more money.  None of the statements have the actual payment we made on the 24th.  ATI actually owes us money because they charged us for more times than I actually went.  No matter how many times you talk to or email someone, nothing changes.  I have multiple emails with zero follow through on their part."
Fantastic staff and facilities... Very attentive to what's needed to accomplish my goals... Thank you!
"I love Rebecca and her staff! She‚Äôs very professional and care about her patients. I‚Äôve worked with mostly all the therapists and they are great. I wish I could take one home with me lol but honestly, they are the best therapy Buisness I‚Äôve ever seen or have experience with.

DAB"
Very friendly staff and occupational therapist  r wonderful!
"The staff are confident, educated in the newest treatments, helpful, friendly, and most of all they don't rush us old folks..
Cat"
"Excellent PTs no matter who you see and what your need is. From check in to equipment, music, smiles...they have it all! My main PTs were Rebecka, Elisa, and Tristen. They were awesome!"
The atmosphere is awesome I love how they relate and empathize with you every time you go in for therapy the physical therapists are phenomenal I would definitely recommend this facility!#Rebecca#Nelson#Tristen
The therapists do a good job. I believe they are over booked and are unable to fully focus on each patient.
Great people to work with. They make sure you understand how and why the treatment you are about to receive.
These are excellent professionals who are kind and sincerely care about my injury and healing. Thank you!
"I have been really pleased with the care my therapist have given me after shoulder surgery! They are kind, professional, and work you hard but not to the point of DREAD!!!!!! Elliot and Tristan are wonderful, caring professionals and I am very pleased with my progress and I AM PAIN FREE after a nasty rotator cuff surgeryü§ó"
Great people. Great care.
Such a welcoming environment! I felt truly cared for and I could tell they wanted the best for me and my health.
"Great therapists who know their stuff.  Receptionists are very friendly and welcoming.  Highly recommend ATI - Seneca, SC"
High quality care and consideration
"Very professional and friendly, they work as a team .I think that's important I would recommend them to anyone"
Great staff
Great!  Significant improvement on 2nd session. Continued improvement.








































"It has been a wonderful experience working with Chris the last few weeks.  He has been very encouraging and supportive.  Chris has introduced me to  exercises that I thought I could not do because of my bad knees. Working with the bar and free weight has inspired me.

I was so excited that I could manage a treadmill again as well as the bike.  I have surprised myself.  It is awesome  because I know that he has my best interest in mind.

I leave with a refreshed feeling, renewed and encouraged that ""I can do this""!

Thanks Chris!

I will recommend PT SOLUTIONS , Brady Avenue, for therapy.   The staff has been wonderful.  I no longer feel defeated because of the positive interaction and care."
"Would highly recommend Chris! He‚Äôs friendly, professional, patient, and he makes rehab interesting. He‚Äôs also extremely knowledgeable and can answer any question in as much or as little detail as you want."
"The people in this place are AMAZING!!! I am 25 and have been having chronic neck pain all my life, but it recently got worse so my physician recommended I go to physical therapy. I am SO grateful I chose PT Solutions in West Midtown!! D is an incredible physical therapist. She listens well and observes your movements and reactions with great knowledge, adjusting your therapy as you go. She also gives a variety of exercises for you to do so you don't get bored, and keeps really fun conversation going during your session. She is able to keep great attention even when she has 2-3 patients in at a time, which is incredible in itself! I feel empowered when I leave, and my pain has decreased significantly!!
Sam is also amazing behind the desk! He is always on top of scheduling and sending reminders, and is also extremely friendly! He made sure I completely understand how my insurance would work before I got started, and was very patient with me as this was one of my first times handling my own medical payments.
This is a great team and I highly recommend coming here!"
"Chris, Hannah, and Katlyn have been amazing. They are so nice and take the time to get to know you. My experience here was awesome!"
The recovery journey I experienced with pt solutions was like no other and was truly AMAZING! They got me back doing what made me happy in no time!!
Dee is my FAVORITE! I was always looking forward to going to therapy. It was my judge free zone with good conversation and great workouts! I‚Äôve been in on days where it was just me and then other days it‚Äôs a room full and let me tell you she does a awesome job multitasking and keeping up with EVERYONE! I‚Äôd give her 10 stars if I could! If you need therapy see Dee!! She‚Äôs well recommended!
"I have done PT in a few places for different injuries. I cannot recommend D‚ÄôMarlowe at PT Solutions enough. She is fiercely intelligent about her field and also people-smart. She knows just how to push you to improve at your highest level without ever letting you feel defeated. I also appreciate how holistic she is about thinking about the body and movement as well as daily activities. I‚Äôm nearly done after three full months of PT for a badly sprained ankle, and I believe much of my remarkable (to me, anyway) progress is due to her incredible skill set. The entire environment is very positive, and the other patients all seem to respond so well to D‚ÄôMarlowe‚Äôs work with them (there are sometimes other therapists who help who are also great). Her administrator, Sam, is also incredibly compassionate and knowledgeable about insurance issues, etc. I am grateful my doctor at Emory recommended PT Solutions for my injury and that this worked out so well. Don‚Äôt hesitate if you‚Äôre thinking about it!"
D‚ÄôMarlowe is an excellent therapist with a superb therapy program.  Covid protocol safe. All the equipment needed for physical rehabilitation.  Comfortable plans that insure progress without stress. Convenient location.  These guys are good. They listen and give and take feedback.  I am confident that they are helping me to get better.
"I love it here. Great vibes. The staff is wonderful. Professional establishment. They‚Äôre very conscious of each patient and their needs and goals. They work with you and give you the tools you need in order to succeed while you‚Äôre in physical therapy. Flexible hours +++. Parking is the only issue that I had with the place, I‚Äôve since learned that it was beneficial for me. I recommend this facility to anyone who needs a great physical therapist."
"PT Solutions on Brady Ave is a valued member of my MS care team! The service is consistently respectful, convenient and personalized. With dry needling sessions, I have been able to reduce utilization of medications for severe muscle spasms. I highly recommend PT Solutions for those needing physical therapy services on the west side of Atlanta. Ask for D‚ÄôMarlow!"
"Fractured my C1 vertebrae and spent 6 months in a neck brace.  Started treatment in December 2020 and have had excellent and responsive staff that adapted my treatment on a minute by minute basis during sessions. 3 months later and I just finished a 4-day golf bachelor party with no neck pain or mobility issues. If you plan on getting injured, I strongly recommend this location for your physical therapy."
"I've been a patient here for almost three months and couldn't be happier! The staff are superb, making me feel truly cared for. Dee, Mollie and Sam are special folks! They created a program to address my specific needs - migraines, back issues and a degenerative neurological disease. The progress I've made is keeping me active and for this I'm thankful. The location is also great with plenty of easy parking. If you're in need of physical therapy, this is THE place to go!"
"Whether recovering from surgery, experiencing abnormal pain, or unsure how to begin your modified fitness journey, PT Solutions of West Atlanta is THE PLACE! I refer all of my friends to D'Marlowe (the more reviews you read, the more you know why!) because she is not only extremely knowledgeable but attentive and thoughtful in every action. It is pure joy to walk through the doors at PT Solutions and every moment I spend with the team in their care is a gift! If you don't like going to your PT appointment as much as I do, you are in the wrong spot!"
"I made a lot of progress with my chronic injury/pain here, and always felt really supported when I was struggling - I highly recommend working with Dee if you get the chance!"
"Great! Clean, nicely designed, and great service. D'Marlowe is extremely good at what she does. She asks all the right questions and can answer any question I give her when I try to understand my body and how my daily activities impact it. Fun environment, kind and talented practitioner, and great service overall."
"Come here if your body hurts and you feel helpless to chronic pain. D‚ÄôMarlowe is a skilled clinician, hilarious storyteller, and kind friend. I felt powerless to chronic pain for so long, and my experience here has not only provided significant physical relief, but also empowerment‚Äîas she has taught me strategies to relieve and prevent this pain moving forward. She listens deeply and responds according to your needs.

She and her colleague Sam are witty, empathetic, fun, and full of life. I love hanging out with them even as we make progress on the pain. 10/10!"
The staff at PT is awesome. I learned a lot of beneficial things to maintain my health and strength. They really care about you individually! PT rocks!
"Changed my life! I‚Äôm a fan of D‚ÄôMarlowe and Sam for life! Fun, engaging, kind people. And D took time to really understand what was going on for me. It took time, but after first walking through the doors in 2019, I am soooo much better Feb 2021! Took the time and care no one else would with my injury. Learned a lot about how the body works so I can continue improving myself for life. Eternally grateful for the FRIENDS I made who also so happen to be lifesavers."
The staffs are nice and professional.  Massage and exercises make me feel better.
My back was in pain from a bad fall and the team at PT Solutions of West Atlanta are helping me to feel better!! Thank you.. what a great team !!!
"Awesome, happy, & positive staff ! The healing process has been awesome with their guidance!"
"Showed concern for my injury, and practiced great technique to get me back healthy. I would recommend to my friends and family. Great service and facility."
Very professional staff dee is the best....
"Very great service, very professional, very courteous, just very good in all things."
Physical therapy treatment at this location met my medical recovery goal as prescribed by my doctor.
So worth the time spent here. I was so nervous starting PT for the first time in my life to rehab from a broken knee. Mollie and Dee and the whole staff at PT Solutions were great at putting my mind at ease. They gave me the encouragement to push myself to do more than I thought I could. The place is always upbeat and encouraging and they have a great vibe.
Really cool people at this location!
Dee and all the staff at PT solutions were amazing! I came to them post surgery on my shoulder. They were very attentive to my pain and problem areas. My shoulder strength and range of motion are now better than ever. Thank you guys so much!!
"Best Physical Therapy in town! Mollie and D'Marlowe are so knowledgeable and caring in their practice. I've had incredible gains in strength and movement just in a couple of months. Plus their assistants are so helpful! The space overall is really positive and fun! I look forward to going every time and will miss them when I'm done.
If you have to go to Physical Therapy, go here. You'll love it and get better at the same time!"
"I highly recommend PT Solutions!  Dee, Richard and Jacquelle are gems in the industry and assisted in making my recovery remarkable!  Dee is very patient, knowledgeable who prepares a customized plan of care for your rehabilitation needs.  They also enjoyed my immense sense of humor (HA!)."
"Staff is AWESOME and the treatment is even better! Dee, RT, Jacquelle, Mollie, and Megan really push you to reach your goals and want to see you better. Love this place! 10/10 and would reccomend for anyone looking for a new physical therapist."
Wonderful experience here. The staff is amazing and always makes sure you feel comfortable. The expercises and information they gave was super helpful. I came in because of a torn ACL and I‚Äôve have such great process and success because of them. Highly recommended this location.
because of PT Solutions I am now able to walk without pain. They take the time to explain to you what to do and Why you need to do it. This is the Best PT I have ever been to.
"Professional and friendly, make you feel welcome. Focusing on the areas that need therapy and explain everything as they go. BIG UPS..."
A great facility with an amazing group of people welcoming you from the moment you first visit and every visit after. 10/10 would recommend.
The staff is amazing ! They worked with my schedule and outlined a plan specific to me. I couldn‚Äôt ask for better service and care.
"- Dangerous to go to for physical therapy here!
- Therapist booked 2-3 additional patients per appt.
- Therapist had trouble effectively watching everyone.
- Without proper supervision improper technique of exercise were done.
- Would go unnoticed until several sets.
- Someone fell off a bosu ball.
- A child was on the weight machines and made a loud noise with the weight and she said she would assume he is ok since his mom was standing there.
-They charge almost double what other physical therapists costs.
- You pay for a one on one therapist like everywhere else and don't get the service, instead you get distracted treatment.
- With so many patients therapist would forget vital conversations about pain caused from exercises.
- Therapist was unable to deviate from text book learning and modify for the additional pain being caused in another part of the body from her treatment.
- Therapist and customer service rep. did not have could client service skills, and did not remedy their treatment or service to fix the issue.
- I would recommend Atlanta Sport and Spine. They were wonderful."
"I have enjoyed my therapy and the positive energy in this place. To top it off, the pain and swelling due to my injury has improved."
Awesome therapy spot! I would recommend to anyone!
My first time going to PT Solutions went well.
The staff is amazing...very professional
PT Solutions is where restorations begins from your injury














The staff at Benchmark Therapy on Tobacco are such a caring team.  My therapist Aubrey is truly concerned about my issues.  When I first began there I was concerned about Covid.  They soon put my fears to rest.  Every machine and equipment is cleaned between each client.  This team is very professional and make you feel like you are part of their family!  Love y‚Äôall!
The BenchMark staff is always welcoming and friendly. Brian is a great Physical Therapist. I recommend him over anyone. His dry needling skills are great. He sets realistic goals and his skill sets make them happen. (Needs more than 5 stars)
"I received excellent care at Benchmark Physical Therapy. The atmosphere was very pleasant and the staff were friendly and easygoing. Brian Cook not only gets you feeling better immediately, he‚Äôs also educating you during sessions. He is very effective and knowledgeable, getting impressive results in less time than I expected. Brian is also very kind and compassionate, and it‚Äôs clear he genuinely cares about his patients.  The true test is that I‚Äôm able to continue improving on my own, using the tools he gave me. I highly recommend Benchmark and Brian Cook for excellent patient care."
"Energetic and professional staff who provided a wonderful personal experience.
Utilized the latest skills and techniques to rehab my broken bicep.
Therapist Justin Williams especially demonstrated compassion, direction, gave clearly defined goals and exercises, and allowed scheduling flexibility during my rehab.
The facility was bright, clean, adhered to Covid safety protocols, and exceeded my expectations.
M Smith. M.D."
"Therapy was successful! They are a caring, and knowledgeable group. They educate you throughout your therapy appointments, providing helpful ways to continue to heal and maintain good health once therapy is complete."
This place is great! Very professional and knowledgeable staff. They know what they are doing when it comes to physical therapy.  If you have any need for physical therapy I highly suggest that you get your doctor to send you to benchmark!
"Had one session and cancelled all future session. I requested to be sent elsewhere. There were three women up front at the reception talking so loudly, I could barely hear my therapist. At one point one got up and turned the music up. My PT asked her to turn it down.  Very unprofessional atmosphere. I am not returning.  Too bad because I like the therapist."
"I‚Äôve been battling muscle imbalance in my shoulders for years now. Working with Emily, Brian, and the rest of their team, I was able to isolate the causes of my shoulder pain and get on a routine to correct the problem. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place. Would definitely recommend"
"Brian is the most kind, compassionate, and empathetic healthcare professional I've had the pleasure of working with. He was committed to my healing process in every way- talking me through my mental blocks and fears just as carefully and thoughtfully as he did the physical aspects each step of the way. While he needed to handle familial things, the entire rest of the office took turns stepping up to take care of me. Each and every one of them made my healing process almost a pleasant one; I looked forward to seeing them every time I had PT. I cannot recommend this practice enough!"
"I am extremely pleased with the care I received at Benchmark. Justin Williams and staff treated me like family. I have been treated for two separate unrelated injuries. Both rehabs were a complete success. I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else.

Stevie Fast Jackson"
"Omg :) where should I begin! Brian cook is the best. He is very professional, Knowledgeable and caring! I have never been to a Chiropractor he made me feel welcomed. I greatly appreciate you Brian!"
"I've had physical therapy here twice - once for my back and hand (carpal tunnel - avoiding surgery) and once again for physical therapy for my hand after carpal tunnel surgery.

I cannot remark enough about the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. They become family after a few visits! Since most of the staff are young enough to be my children, it's like I gained a few more children during my time there! Greigh, Justin, Brian, Trey, Alex, and Traci have all helped me and shown concern that I was improving and tried different modes of therapy in working toward improvement with my problems.

I am much better than I was and my hand has much improved with the physical therapy after my surgery.

I heartily recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy for your physical therapy needs. I've been to other companies for physical therapy in the years past but none have come close to the different modes of therapy I experienced while at Benchmark.

(Note: This specifically related to the Augusta Exchange office but I believe that all locations would be the same.)"
"These guys are great. Mr Scott, Mr Cook and Ms Marcy took care of me. Very professional, knowledgeable and explained everything in detail they wanted me to do. They really have been great for my recovery."
The most wonderful therapist and office personnel to take care of your needs. I feel better each time I leave BenchMark. Thank you staff for your attention to detail. Well done.
Very professional and awesome staff.  They explained every exercise and the importance of the exercise. I have been to therapy prior to a different company in the area and saw minimal improvement and saw a different therapist each time. At Benchmark I saw the same therapist and had excellent results! I highly recommend.
"I came into BenchMark very skeptic about doing physical therapy. My doctor wanted me to give it a try before getting injections. Everyone there was so nice, helpful, and encouraging that I decided to go more than the required 2 sessions to meet insurance requirements. 4 weeks later, I can now pick up my grandkids pain free!!"
I had a wonderful experience at Benchmark Physical Therapy! All the staff are very friendly and the physical therapists are very knowledgeable. Brian helped me with my lower back issues and sciatic nerve pain. 10/10 would recommendüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº
I have nothing but great things and to say about the staff here!! Justine is excellent...got me on the mend and headed to full use of my elbow! I could not be more pleased with my progress. He and the whole staff are great at what they do. Thanks for the hard work.
"Scott is very personable, and knowledgeable in all manner of PT... Marcy is a gem and wise beyond her years!"
"I‚Äôve dealt with severe neck and upper back pain for a long while, where it felt like I had knives stabbed into me... and after coming here I was able to completely alleviate my pain and also learn how to stop the pain in the future.
I‚Äôm happy to say I have been pain free ever since !"
"I had a head injury a year ago,leaving me with bad head aches,pain in rightside of neck,shoulder and upper back.unable to move my head and raise my right arm,pretty messed up.thought i was going to stay this way.was giving a referral to benchmark and introduced to Scott Aronld. He used 'dry needling'.The pain starting going away during the first visit,I've been back a couple more visits and the pain and tension is cut way down,able to move my head and raise my my arm,and sleep finally. I'm in better place in a short time, Scott eraser my pain. The staff is very pleasnt and helpful, the healing starts walking in the door.
Thank You BenchMark

kenny"
"I was a intern at this location in the spring of 2018. The staff here are GREAT!! They are very knowledgeable, kind, and caring. I highly recommend BenchMark Physical therapy."
I love everyone there! Scott my physical therapist is awesome sauce!!!
Great job pinpointing an aggravated sartorius muscle and exercises to strengthen it.
Lack needed equipment. Mostly interns. Overcharge as compared to other rehab places. Support system for customers is seriously lacking. Not on time for appointments which is kind of crazy since it is not a dr office.
Friendly therapists and staff that really take time to get to know you. Excellent treatment and welcoming atmosphere!
The staff was amazing to work with!!!
Very friendly and knowledgeable therapists and staff!!











I absolutely love this place! I have been there after 2 surgeries and they are so informative and I trust them completely. I have been to other physical therapist and I have to say that Stephanie and Mary are by far the best! I would recommend them to everyone and have!
"Shelley & the rest of the staff are so awesome! I was somewhat nervous after surgery having to go to PT & it being painful. However, they don‚Äôt push you to do things that are painful & just have you doing things that you are comfortable doing & that are what‚Äôs best for you! Highly recommend them."
"I would like to give a shout out to PT Solutions of Cartersville. I have been going there for a couple of weeks for physical therapy after having surgery. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable and the Henderson Drive location is close to my home, so it‚Äôs very convenient. I highly recommend them."
this place is awesome !!üòù
Shelly and the others have been a tremendous blessing and help in my recovery from knee replacement surgery. Its hard work but it's really paying off. If you really want to recover this is where to go.
Poor Communication Skills got a Referral originally from my PCP for my back and leg then I started therapy then I got a Referral from the foot and Ankle doctor for my foot I took them the Referral from the foot and Ankle center but today I was suppose to have therapy they cancelled on me cause they didn't realize to I was suppose to gave therapy on my feet as well so they cancelled on regular therapy POOR COMMUNICATION SKILLS.
"Nice open areas, friendly staff, they show genuine concern for their patients."
"Love the staff! They do everything in their power to make you feel comfortable and keep you smiling.
Thanks you guys!"
Everyone is friendly & knowledgeable about their craft. I felt at ease at all times. They made sure that I understood the exercises & other parts of therapy. I would highly recommend PT Solutions to anyone.
A GREAT GROUP FOR ALL UR PHYSICAL THERAPY NEEDS ...
A great place to visit for all your physical therapy need very professional and a comfortable environment you always leave feeling better each time you receive treatment
"I recently had knee surgery and chose PT Solutions on Henderson Dr. The front desk clerk always greets me with a smile, as well as the techs. The exercises are very effective in aiding the healing process and the staff/techs are always helpful, always courteous and always always professional."
"I realize this is a large company throughout the Southeast, but it needs to concentrate on fewer offices and more equipment and staff.  The reason I disliked my experience was because they had little to no equipment to aid in recovery.  I had a ruptured/repaired Achilles Tendon.  They have no weight machines, one treadmill, and one bike.  There was no way to strengthen my legs besides lunges and squats which I can do at home.  They also constantly seemed to be rotating or losing staff.  The staff had never seen an injury like mine and honestly, I'm not sure they knew how to treat it.  Most of the staff was courteous, but some of the fill in people could have benefited from an attitude adjustment."
"BECKY, BRANDI, SHELLY, AND PARKER MAKE A GREAT TEAM TO DO THERAPY WITH. EACH WORKING WITH EACH OTHER TO TAKE CARE OF THE PATIENT  AND WITH THE BEST ATTITUDES"
Everyone is extremely nice!!










Stephanie is awesome. She spent so much time with me going over my history and diagnosis. Developed the plan of care with me. Very polite. Very understanding. Everyone at this location in Snellville was so good and kind to me. Even after I had to make multiple appointment changes.
Jerri is very helpful to my needs in recouping from my hip replacement and very friendly
"Very welcoming, pleasant, proficient and no waiting.  I am now walking without pain."
"Tammy is a great PT, but things are getting a bit too busy. She's having to spend time training a new PT, and when there's more than one patient booked at a time, there's often too much idle time between the time I finish one exercise and she can tell me the next one to do."
"Very knowledgeable, caring, and informative.Really made me feel comfortable as a patient."
"My experience at this facility is absolutely MARVELOUS!  Starting with the Front Desk, Mandy has excellent customer service experience. She greets you with a smile and a very pleasant helpful attitude. My Physical Therapist Jerri Cable is Awesome!  She explains everything to me that she does such as massages;  great explanation of how to operate the machines and a very pleasant and caring attitude! I look forward to my appointments at the Emory Rehabilitation Center where you are cared for in an excellent manner!"



Had being there to get treated ! Praveen and his staff are well knowledge to understand the reported issue and they er way to build patient confidence on conservative treatment is marvelous .
"The physical therapists here are so kind and patient, and I feel my treatment for chronic pain here has been the best treatment I have tried these past four painful years."


"I had unsuccessfully tried to resolve for a twisted sacrum/SI joint pain with a chiropractor for 2+ months. Dr. Morgan Green @ BenchMark PT-Upper Hembree location my issues in just 1 visit! Today was my first day without pain. I am pleasantly surprised and so relieved to be pain free! Dr. Green shared exercises and a plan of action to help me stay pain free! I am so grateful to be able to resume walking my dogs, lite jogging and sit/standing with no bone popping sounds or pain. Wow, thank you!"
"If you‚Äôre in need of PT this is the place to go. The Hembree Office is the best, you have personal attention from the therapist Elliott. I am 100% better because of his knowledge and help. Highly recommend them if you are in pain!!"
"I would like to Thank the team at Benchmark on Upper hembree road for their kindness and compassion.  My therapist was very knowledgeable  and explained every thing to me. While  going to them I was pain free, and getting the instructions on what to do while at home. They are wonderful and I want to say thank you all very much."
"Dr. Brent, Kat, and Alexis is an amazing staff! I enjoyed my time at this location from the beginning to the end. The staff is friendly and so motivating. I didnt think they were going to be able to help my body get back to where it was but i feel so much better now üòÅ."
"I had my knee scoped a few months ago and chose this Benchmark location to do my PT.
I could not be more happy with the treatment I received.
The majority of the sessions were done by Abbey who is very knowledgeable and patient, but the whole staff was awesome.
During my therapy I also worked with Claressa, and Hailey. Between the three of them the treatment I received was outstanding.
Alexis made sure my appointments were made and that I had a schedule to know when I needed to be there and was always pleasant if I needed to reschedule or cancel an appointment. Due to my work schedule this happened a few times.
For about a year before my surgery I could not walk properly or without pain. Since having the surgery and completing the PT I am pain free and was able to very much enjoy the vacation I took this weekend.
I can't say thank you or recommend this location and this staff enough."
The most amazing people work here!  They work so incredibly well as a team.  Everyone of them is there to help you and has a smile on their face.  These things matter when you are in pain and do not feel well- the reason most of us go to physical therapy.  Great clinicians who provide excellent care!!!!
"Amazing staff! Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable and they make the patients feel welcome and taken care of. Nothing good ever brings one to need physical therapy, but this staff brings fun and determination to the healing process. I highly recommend!"
Had a partial knee replacement and chose this location for my rehab. The staff was incredibly friendly. The PTs are very knowledgeable and dedicated. Highly recommend this practice.
Brent and Clare help me a lot after my car accident. My back hasn‚Äôt felt better in a long time. Great staff. Great atmosphere.
"Dr. Brent Davis and staff are superb and go out of their way to help with whatever is hurting you.  After an operation, it is hard work (in many cases torture) to regain motion in the knee. But they worked hard to help me reach my goal and made it fun, as well!"
I went in with hip pain and they helped me with stretching and strength exercises which really helped. They whole staff made it fun. I highly recommend this facility.
"After suffering from chronic plantar fasciitis and visiting 2 MD's with no relief, I opted for PT.
After just 5 visits with Pavel Gorokhov and dry needling I am finally experiencing relief. I plan on continuing this treatment and highly recommend.
Pavel is knowledgeable, confident and results oriented. Follow his course of therapy and you will see results.
Highly recommend Benchmark and most especially Pavel!
Excellent staff as well, very efficient."
These guys far exceeded my expectations.  I broke my ankle at the end of December and wasn't expecting to be walking without crutches until May.  Claressa and Hailey had me walking crutchless by the end of March!  So happy I went here.   The whole staff really made me feel like family.  I actually miss them.   Would definitely go back if therapy was ever needed again.
"After my total hip replacement surgery on March 5, 2018, I received post-surgery physical therapy from Benchmark Physical Therapy located on Hembree Road.  The care provided at that location by Claressa and Abigail far exceeded my expectation.   I was extremely pleased with the administrated support, physical therapy, and attention I received and will refer anyone needing PT to this location.  I suppose you can say I hopped into Benchmark and danced my way out."
"The team provided really first class service over the 12 weeks that I received rehab for my second knee replacement. Over the last 10 years, Bench Mark has helped me rehab torn Achilles Tendon, should replacement and two knee replacements. If they were not good, I would not keep coming back. Claressa Brekke, DPT is the latest Clinic Director and brings her own personal concerns and effort to provide the best rehab possible. Alexis McDowell and Hailey Munger complete a really excellent team."
"Very satisfied with the treatments received from this great group of professionals, particularly Claressa Brekke."
The staff here is very friendly and knowledgeable.
Highly recommend


"From the moment I walked into PTSolutions on Peach Orchard Rd I was greeted with such warmth. Lindsey was so professional gracious and kind. My need for PT had been weighing on me heavily. At 62, I knew I was going to have to learn to live with degenerative arthritis in my neck. Only surgical option was fusion of my vertebrae that was a FAT NO. Injections were also an option NOT A FAN of needles. Physical Therapy seemed to be the best choice for me. When I met Stew he assured me the pain was manageable with exercise and he was gonna show me how. I loved going 3days a week for 9weeks. Along with Stew, Maddie, Natalie, Savina (student) & other PT patients inspired and encouraged me. Wow in the beginning going in feeling low, and then at the end leaving on top of the world! Stew is a force of nature he definitely chose the right profession he is a natural motivator. At Stews guidance, Savina a student doing her first of two 15 week clinicals worked with me mostly after my 2nd week. We worked great together. I want to wish her the best life has to offer. I left there with a better understanding of what was required of me to live a better quality of life.  Physical Therapists CARE! Great bunch of young professionals!!! They changed my life. Will miss them very much‚ù§"
"The entire staff are very professional. They are very attentive to my needs. Mattie and Steward make you feel safe and listened to. They both go above and beyond. With every visit I get stronger and more confident. I call PT solutions the best gym every. I tell every one this is the place to go. Lots of love from everyone Lindsey, Latoya and Kaylee y'all are the bomb. Happy happy happy. I feel great and happy when I leave them every visit."
"Dr. Stew Kremer is absolutely knowledgeable in his profession. He has a heart of gold and is only interested in the patient full physical recovery along with thier emotional healing the experiences.

Maddie Quail is also very helpful and lifts everyone spirits to make physical therapy a little less painful by getting patients to laugh and focus on positive things while working.

I could only give 5 stars but these two professionals make this place a 10 in my book."
"Mattie and Stu are the best. I've never been to physical therapy before, but they put you at ease. Very nice place to go for physical therapy"
"Excellent Staff Members. Very Well Train and Knowledgeable Concerning Physical Treatment also Courteous keeps you Smiling before you leave out the door. Best in Augusta, Georgia."
I really enjoy my visits at PT Solutions. The staff is very friendly a patient with the clients. Even though I come in for chronic pain issues I always leave feeling better.üòç
We loved PT Solutions!! Maddie and Latoya are very welcoming and the entire staff worked well with my little guy. They are the Best!!!
"Great place. All of the staff os great
Treat you just like family. Toya is awesome that's my favorite senior PSC. MADDIE IS THE ONLY PERSON I WILL SEE. GREAT PLACE"

"A kind, professional, caring office.

I have been working through a chronic issue with my spine at this location for about nine months exclusively during the pandemic, and I have seen many patients come through this location. Everyone, both the patients and the staff have been open, kind, and complied with COVID regulations in a way that was respectful and safe.

Mattie, the clinic director, is one the most dedicated and flexible professionals I have ever worked with. She responds well to individual clients, their goals, their needs, and their progress.

Never have I felt more listened to, or more empowered to understand and manage my body‚Äôs pain and my body‚Äôs healing.

I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt mention this office‚Äôs support staff, Amber. Amber is a wizard with insurance companies, and with scheduling flexibility. She‚Äôs a wonderful conversationalist, as are the rest of the staff in the office.

Overall the atmosphere is fun, but you always know you‚Äôre there to work, to learn, and to feel better. The office may appear small and simply outfitter, but the work is centered on learning how to replicate therapy without a $$$ gym or personal coach once therapy concludes

This is a place that really is about solutions. No one who works here will discharge you once you‚Äôre ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù. The standard in this office is to get each client to self-resilience, and it shows.

If you want to just function? Any PT office will do. If you want to leave your helplessness behind, and truly find a solution? This is the only office I can recommend."

"PT Solutions is great! The staff are friendly, patient, and kind. They really make going through physical therapy easier. They are also very accommodating and will shift your goals according to the progress you do/ don‚Äôt make during your treatment with them. 10/10 would recommend them to anyone needing physical therapy!"
Great place and professionals. Thank you for helping my little one!
I love this group! They are very knowledgeable and have helped me before and after surgery! Everyone is friendly and treat you like family!!!
"Caring staff, competent in what they do.  Helping me after no one else could figure out the source of my pain"
Staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. COVID guidelines are followed.   I have had physical therapy at several other places and PT Solutions is the best.
"A real standout crew... these people care about your well being and I mean they really do, they don‚Äôt just help you with therapy they take it a step further and show concern with your personal life even going the extra mile to call you on the phone just to see how you have been holding up and if you are looking to get your therapy done but also have a cool conversation victor is the guy to talk to... I love this place and I love the people in it. PT solutions along with my doctor Christopher Potts have inspired me to strive and be a better person and I hope they can do the same for you"
"I've been a patient at the Johns Creek location now for about 5 months due to a car accident and the staff has been absolutely fabulous from day one! They have remained professional, very thorough in the skills they possess, they have definitely helped to improve my overall health by reducing my pain, they've been flexible with my work schedule, all while making me feel at home each visit. I would recommend them to every one who needs PT. Johns Creek ROCK!!!"
Best PT place I have ever been to. I believe the approach change for me from just stretching to working on strengthening was extremely helpful. This will be my new plan for the future!!!
"I wouldn't trust anybody else after seeing Mike here. He truly cares, and is very knowledgable."
Would give it 0 stars if I could. They billed my insurance 1000 dollars for one hours of physical therapy. STAY AWAY
"This is the most awesome Physical Therapy group ever!!!! I was so nervous at first, now I can't wait for my days to go. I feel better when I leave and I have no doubt I'm in good hands. The P.T.'s there are outstanding and very personal. They truly care."
I got good results and I think the staff is competent and friendly.  I am glad to recommend PT Solutions.
I have been here off and on for 4 years now with varying injuries. They always explain the mechanics of my injury so that I can understand. I have been treated with professionalism and care and would highly recommend PT Solutions Johns Creek.
"This is by far the best physical therapy center I've ever been to, and I've been to many. They incorporate traditional therapy along with a more holistic approach for allowing the body to heal. They won't start you on a regimin that is too difficult for your personal preferences, but can still get you on the right track for healing. I highly recommend this place."
The best of the best!!
"I struggled with golfer's elbow for almost a year, had been to two other doctors, and finally went to an ortho who prescribed PT after a negative x-ray. I chose PT solutions as my family had gone there for other issues and could not be happier. Lydia has an extreme focus on her patients, is always looking for how to adjust to continue improving your injury, and you can tell she is totally prepared (many doctors you feel like they read your chart or prepared for you right before seeing you). My elbow hadn't improved at all over about 7 months but has gotten dramatically better after 2-3 months of PT here, to the point that I am back to playing tennis 3-4 times a week (which I haven't been able to do in over a year). Lydia and her staff are extremely dedicated and friendly. I would highly recommend."
"These guys are awesome. A wonderful experience by the entire staff , especially Michael Finlay. Competent, friendly, compassionate and patient friendly operation."
Great PT sessions with Victor. So helpful and getting me on the right track. Thank you
High quality of personal care and professional knowledge.
I have been coming to PT solutions for two years for various injuries and have loved the treatment I have received. Mike and his staff truly care about getting you back to your sport!
Staff is very knowledge and has my best interest in mind.
"Stay away!!! This company is committing fraud through double billing and threats of collection.  This location treated my son in 2014.  We paid a $60 copay for every single session, in addition to what insurance covered.  Over 2 years later they have come out of nowhere attempting to collect *again* on what we have already paid, and forcing us to pull records from our bank and credit cards to prove we paid.  Unethical business you should definitely NOT do business with.  I am reporting them to my insurance company and the BBB."
"Nice staff, questionable billing.  I had to go there for a long time after surgery...for more than 6 months prior to the Wellstar buyout and another 9 months thereafter.  Things were great pre-Wellstar but pricing went way up afterwards.  After 6 months under Wellstar they started billing my insurance double units (for same treatment type) and didn't tell me...I found out months later after getting the extra bills.  This brings the co-insurance to nearly triple of what I'd have to pay at a non-Wellstar owned place.  That's robbery and poor practice no matter how nice the therapists are."
You and your Staff are absolutely the best in the World.
"Knowledgeable and friendly staff, flexible schedule"
Wonderful people










"The Tyrone branch of PT Solutions has a skilled and attentive staff. My recovery has improved rapidly since beginning with their therapists. Two of them, Drs. Aguado and Corniiaud, even took the time to accompany me on a follow up surgical visit in order to gain insights applicable to my treatment. Highly recommended!"
"Taylor,

Seriously thanks for everything you did to help me! I really do wish I had a workout partner or could afford a training partner like you.  I am added the exercises into the routine.  I never thought I could do a plank and move a 25lb plate and walking with the 15lb kettle bells gave me a lot of confidence in my strength and cardio.  My neck, shoulder and back are much much better and stronger!

The entire staff at the Tyrone location are very professional and thorough with the treatment!

Again, seriously, thanks!!!

Don"
"PT Solutions of Tyrone is AWESOME!! The exceptional care that I received from the therapists and staff was incredible. The staff made me feel welcome, they were very friendly and helpful. The therapists were extremely knowledgeable, professional, caring and always positive. During my rehabilitation, I enjoyed every session and was able to accomplish my physical goals and do exercises that I thought I would never be able to do. The encouragement that I received and enthusiastic that the therapists displayed, motivated me to go above and beyond in every session; it was very apparent that they were concerned about my well-being. Words cannot express how grateful I am to have had the opportunity to experience such excellent care and treatment at PT Solutions. Thank you ladies for taking such good care of me!!  I would HIGHLY recommend PT Solutions of Tyrone to anyone for their PT needs."

They know how to push you just the right amount and are very positive. I would not hesitate whatsoever to recommend them to my family and friends."
An awesome place with great physical therapy and nice people.
"Extremely knowledgeable, friendly, positive and energetic staff.  They were able to completely turn my situation around.  I could barely walk when I started and experienced constant pain.  Through their expertise and enthusiastic support they were able to provide corrective exercise which led to my much improved condition today.  Although I still have some soreness which may be my new normal, I am totally pain free.  They will tell you they were just doing their jobs.  I will tell you they put me back on track to be able to enjoy life.  Thank you Coleigh, LaRissa, Mikari, and Taylor.  You Rock."

I'm still in therapy and I'm so happy to have them helping me. They're available to talk on the phone, drop by with questions or help in addition to regular scheduled appointments.

Pt solutions is a reputable clinic.  My therapist Kristin Summerville has correctly diagnosed my condition.  The exercises are strengthening my leg so far.

"Absolutely amazing PT here. Megan is the third therapist I've been to and haven't had this kind of progress until I started coming here to her. She doesn't overbook, she pays attention to your progress, and knows how to adapt your program on the fly depending on your feedback. Staff is also like family."
I just started going and the staff is AMAZING!!! I would recommend this particular BenchMark to anyone. Very knowledgeable & friendly. By far the best physical therapy experience I've ever had.
"Amazing PT, Megan. Helpful and takes the time to work with me. #roadtorecovery"
"Unprofessional, rude therapist, dismissed me before even evaluating me! Never go there"


"Noble and the staff were wonderful. I had to pay out of pocket and they offered great option treatments for me. I am now in the process of my knee recovery and I couldn't be happier of the decision I made of coming here. Nobel is great & funny! made me feel comfortable and pushed me to go a little further each time. The place is clean, music is on point and environment is safe and comfortable.  10/10"
BILLING SCAM. I went to PT  for frozen shoulder.  First visit I spent 10 minutes Filling paper work.  40 minutes of massage and 10 minutes showing me simple workout while attending to two other patients.   I was told the bill will be $365 which I thought will be submitted to the insurance. Only to realise the insurance was billed $1400 and i need to pay $365.   (For 15m consultation which never happened and 60m of ‚Äúadjustment‚Äù. But was Mainly for a 45 minutes massage.  If you truly  think a massage will fix your issue (which is never the case. It is masking the problem). You are better off going to a spa.   If you want someone to tell you what exercise to do while attending to others .  Just go to utube .   Update I called them after I saw the reply. Nothing changed.
I am very pleased with my experience at PT Solutions of Norcross.   I had complete knee replacement in March and began working with them a few weeks later.  I can honestly say that I had visible improvement after every visit with them.  I was able to resume playing golf at 9 weeks and continued working on strength and range of motion until the leg with the knee replacement has very similar capabilities to my other leg.  Drs. Noble and Konner were very professional and personable and made the experience as pleasant as possible.
I was recovering from rotator cuff surgery after waiting for over a year. After my surgery the PT Solutions staff was so accommodating and professional on getting me back to form. Whether fixing my schedule (Kazue) or fixing my shoulder (Noble and Konner) I was taken care of. Thanks so much for helping me get back to doing the things I love!!
This clinic is great-Konner and Noble are knowledgeable and kind professionals. . Throughout my therapy I understood the prescribed exercises and goals of each session   This clinic gives PT a good name
"This place is amazing and have always been so very kind and respectful. Thanks for all the laughs and good times especially Kazue, Konner, and Noble!!"
"I love how they cater to your specific needs, and help you meet your goals. Gaining back the strength and mobility you may have lost. The staff here is awesome and welcoming! Thanks Noble for helping me through my physical therapy and kazooie for the laughs and sweet personality. ~Shaketa ~"
"After dealing with chronic shin splints for months, I was referred to PT Solutions - and they are FANTASTIC. Everyone is very kind, caring and professional. Kazuhe is always friendly, helpful and brings a cheerful vibe to the center. I‚Äôve worked with Konner for most of the time, and he‚Äôs been wonderful. He is very knowledgeable and attentive to each person he is working with. He had me on a plan that put an end to my shin splints much sooner than I expected. I'm now back to running stronger (and faster!) than ever. I have learned so much. If you‚Äôre needing PT, this is the place to go. I highly recommend it!"
"I was very happy with my treatment at PT solutions.  The therapy following surgery was successively more demanding on each visit and
got me back to much more fluid mobility.  I particularly liked how Konner (Noah) Lindsey gave individual attention, usually with no more than one other patient at a time,  gave me feedback about what might be going on with various aches, always solicited questions, and varied the treatment each week.  The office staff was extremely friendly and efficient."
"Everyone here is super friendly, caring and respectful. They definitely make sure you feel comfortable the whole time you are there. Konner was absolutely amazing and helped me so much with my neck pain. I would 10/10 recommend this place to anyone seeking physical therapy."
They‚Äôre the best nobody like them ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüíØ
"Amazing people full of kindness and encouragement I came because oof foot problems thanks to them im back on track and barley have problems.
Overall amazing people."
"I‚Äôm so glad I found PT Solution Norcross, they are great, efficient, and kind . I highly recommend them!"
Thank you Dr Konner. Lindsey for your help with my daughters ankle and Kazooie for chatting. You guys are the best
"Professional, kind, and knowledgeable. Plus, they‚Äôre flexible, which is great when dealing with mobility issues."
"The positive vibes can be felt in this place from the time you come in until the time you leave - every time.  Alison, Emily, Dominique, etc. are all knowledgeable, attentive and yet fun while administering their recovery therapy tasks.  I would highly recommend this location to anyone needing physical therapy.  I could not have hoped for a better experience."
Awesome all-around staff and professionalism to help you with injury rehab goals!
The physical therapists at PT Solutions are absolutely outstanding! They are extremely helpful and informative about what your particular therapy is all about. The take time to personalize the experience. I highly recommend their services.
Alison was wonderful and very patient with me. I broke my ankle in three places and had surgery to insert screws and a rod. When I went to Alison at PT Solutions I was only able to walk with crutches. She helped me to regain my balance and walking ability. Now 3 months later I am walking unaided and have regained most of my range of motion. PT Solutions was an enjoyable and relaxed place to be. Never was I with many people and had Alison's sole attention. Her staff was always smiling and nice to be around. I would highly recommend this place.
"When you've taken all cancer can throw at you, there comes the end when you're back to living. But, you are so drained of energy.  After my doc's referral, I researched PT Solutions and found what I was looking for.  What a fabulous and caring place!  Everyone is warm and friendly especially when so many patients are overwhelmed with recovery whether it be knee replacement or strength training.  My therapists have been genuine and explained my treatment for the day. They made sure I was comfortable and they talked to me. How novel is that?  Management has hired the right people and you will feel it when  you walk in AND leave.   Best PT I've ever had."
Nothing but the best.  They have been really great.  Very knowledgeable group of people. Everyone that dealt with was professional and kind.  You could not ask for a better group of people to be on your team to get you back to good health.
"I love the PTS team members! They helped me get my life back. They are very friendly, nice, professional, and makes you feel like your part of their family. My therapist Dominique is the best! She is very thorough and make sure you practice great techniques. Thanks PTS NORCROSS!!! SUPER FANTASTIC JOB!!!"
"Chronic pain for years, saw numerous therapists. Nobody could help me until I came here. Alison is the bomb! She's really good at what she does and she provides that extra level of care that is so hard to find. It's refreshing to have someone like that on your team rooting for you. That being said, don't go here. I want them all to myself."
The physical therapists are excellent. I feel that I get very specialized attention and treatment .  I feel better after just one week!
Wonderful place for your physical therapy! I am challenged every time but feel completely supported. Working on getting my knee strong again after surgery. Highly Recommend!!
"From the first day, I felt welcomed and knew that I would be having a very positive experience at PT Solutions, and I was challenged but never discouraged. Alison and her staff kept me motivated. I now can handle stairs with ease. I'm not quite ready for hiking, but will keep this as a goal to shoot for in the future."
"I absolutely love PT Solutions! The staff is amazing, they are all super nice. They do free screening's for people. The staff works with you to become stronger in the area that needs help. One of my favourite things to get done is dry needling, it really helps relieve muscle pain for the week to come."
I highly recommend PT Solutions.  I‚Äôm recovering from back surgery & the entire staff has taken great care of me.  I‚Äôm making great progress & am feeling better than I have in a long time .
Highly recommend coming here. I had a labrum (hip) surgery and was only in town for 2 weeks and saw a lot of improvement after coming here! Alison really knows her stuff and I enjoyed working with her!
The staff is incredibly encouraging and gracious and fun.  The facility is top notch.  Would highly recommend!
"AJ was absolutely outstanding informing our family about the services offered, insurance approval process and unbelievably flexible and responsive scheduling appointments. Dr. Emily has been extremely thorough at each appointment, demonstrating a genuine concern for my son‚Äôs rehabilitation, a keen ability to explore/identify the root cause of his injury and adapting his treatment plan as his rehab progressed."
The staff at PT Solution are great. They help aid my recovery from a auto accident. I would highly recommend therapist Alison to get you back to a a 100%.
"Alison is great, the whole team is friendly, and I can definietly tell a difference in my rotator cuff that was injured. The dry needling was great and the exercises were unique. Would come here again for my PT needs!!"
"I sought out treatment for extreme shoulder pain I was experiencing. I thought for sure I was going to the operating room and a friend encouraged me to give physical therapy a try. Looking for a way to avoid the OR I found Alison at PT Soulutions and I have never looked back. I am amazed at how well I have responded to her treatment. I no longer think I need an operation and couldn‚Äôt  be more happy with my progress. This stuff flat out works. Alison and her staff are kind, caring and compassionate people and I have grown to look forward to my treatments as I know I am improving my overall health and I get to see my friends at PT Soulutions. Thanks Alison, your friendship and dedication to my well being mean the world to me!"
"Aj,abdul, and Emily are great people to work with and they keep me on task to help get me healed."
"Great people and very caring!
Thank you for helping my son aiden!!!
Marissa Hawley"
"I am dealing with a long problem with my arm and hands with numbness and tingling, Im getting treated with Dry needling in Johns creek loaction. still long way to go to full recover but im in good caring hands.

The staff is really friendly an they really care about making me feeling comfortable during the sessions, they always have a smile and have a really good vibe and professionalism."
"Love this place, love the people, hate how hard they work me‚ù§"
"I had rotator cuff shoulder surgery on January 4, 2018 by Dr. Charles Michael Morris, Resurgens of Lawrenceville.  My first visit to PTDr Solutions Norcross was on January 18, 2018.  Because it is part of WellStar, I felt confident, having had positive experiences with them in the past.  The physical therapist, Alison Brock, and receptionist, Marie, are both extremely personable.  Dr. Morris's protocol called for stretching exercises the first 12 weeks (until March 30) because the tissue is still healing.  After 12 weeks, start strengthening exercises.  I went to the clinic 2/week and did my assigned home exercises 4 sets/day for the first month as recommended by Alison Brock.  After the first month, I continued 2/week visits but only did the home exercises 2 sets/day.      On March 19, 2018 at a followup appt. with Dr. Morris, he is disturbed because I cannot do the exercise he requests.  He asks me to describe my assigned PT exercises, growing increasingly upset by what he hears.  He said that none of the following exercises should have been done until after 12 weeks, March 30:  3 resistance band exercises assigned on or prior to Feb. 5.  (The 1st month, I did 4 sets/day for a daily total of 12 sets.), dumbbells - started with 2 lbs & have worked up to 7 lbs., lying on my back lifting a pvc pipe with weight wrapped around it, leaning on table with my body weight on my arms or arm, etc.  (The shoulder  pulley, walking fingers up wall, etc. are all good.)  He concluded by saying he would do an MRI in a month to assess the damage.  I am sick.  All the pain of shoulder surgery only to be harmed by my trusted physical therapist!                                                                                                                      UPDATE:  THE MRI WAS PERFORMED 2 WEEKS LATER AND REVEALED A RECURRENT TEAR OF THE SUPRASPINATUS TENDON!!!  DOCTOR'S NOTES REFERENCE TOO AGGRESSIVE REHABILITATION."
"They‚Äôll treat you right shoutout Allison, Mary Rose and AJ."
Great energy and very knowledgable staff!




Everyone is very nice and very informative. All my questions get answered and I'm feeling better and it's only been 3 weeks since my surgery. I don't like having a different therapist every time I go but everyone is good at what they do!
I couldn‚Äôt believe how good I felt from the first day of therapy. Every time I go my knee is improving. I highly recommend them. I‚Äôm well pleased.
"My husband came here for therapy, every one is nice. Even though my husband is a grumpy one. I‚Äôm going to give them 5 because if they can put up with him they deserve 5 stars. The therapy helped, because he doesn‚Äôt complain about pain anymore."
"The staff are nice, friendly, and informative. It is actually pleasant to take my husband there for physical therapy."
"Thoughtful,considerate, very helpful and one of the staff cleans equipment right after use. Terrific physical therapist team that truly works together for the patient‚Äôs benefit."
"Very well orchestrated. Good management, good therapist. Truly make you feel they are there to help you recover and concerened"
"I have had both Mason and Rusty work with me and they are outstanding!  Now that my knees have been fixed they have included whole joint therapy for my recovery, not just knee rehab"
Sam is my Therapist. I think he‚Äôs great. He‚Äôs very attentive to his patients and listens with concerns and compassion . Sam makes sure that the patient understands the importance of therapy and the reason behind what he‚Äôs doing for his patients to get better and he also demonstrate  to the patients what we need to do at home to help as well.
"Absolutely a great team. Each person has shown personal interest, empathy and knowledge in handling my shoulder replacement recovery"
The faculty is clean and the therapist have been great at working with me
I have been very pleased with the professional attention I have received from the therapist and other staff members.
The staff is extremely friendly and caring. They make you feel so comfortable. Your well being is their main concern. Nice atmosphere. Highly recommended.
"The ATI staff at Greenville street Anderson are a group of very dedicated professionals who go the extra mile

The workers are very friendly and they do a great job and they take great care of their patients
Very professional.  Am excited about the therapies they are having me do to help with my chronic pain.

Anderson ATI wonderful group of people. They invest time to care about each patient as an individual not just a number.
They are very professional and they attend to their patients very well.
Sam is really compassionate he is really making the process of healing better
My son is getting therapy for a few weeks. The atmosphere on the day I took him was very loud and unprofessional. Several therapists (one in particular) was yelling across the room joking with other therapists. I felt patients were not a priority. There was no privacy for people dealing with billing at the front.
A great place for your therapy needs and really nice people to assist you!...
Very professional and knowledgeable.
Great atmosphere and professional staff
"very nice caring people to work with jordon relieved the pain in my back in the first visit and there was progress today when i was there hopefully i will be back to my old self by the end of the treatments, great group of young people to deal with"
I have been coming here to work on my very painful frozen shoulder. Rusty and Lori are awesome and very encouraging and patient with me even when I complain about my pain and give them a hard time. Everyone who  works here has been very kind and helpful. It's the best physical therapy clinic I have ever been to.
"Friendly,  professional staff"
Very nice people in a very tight location. There is NO privacy & too many clients for them to service in a timely manner.
They really have a wonderful team that communicates.  They listen to your symptoms and work to help relieve the discomfort and help you function better.
I really love working with my physical therapist.I really appreciate my therapist hard work.
Very professional
All the therapist are great and very concerend about mine and everyone elses wellbeing

Been going here for various shoulder and knee ailments for years.  The staff then and now are top notch.  I would highly recommend them to you.
I really like it there! Josh is a great Physical Therapist and the entire staff is awesome! Continuing to get better!
Good staff



"A great place for personal attention and encouragement while you work to achieve your therapy goals. The environment is clean and pleasant, and the staff is friendly and professional. I made a great deal of progress in only a few months. I am so grateful for the support they‚Äôve given me!
Thanks!"
Had nothing but great experience at this Benchmark.  Starting with the front desk she is always welcoming and accommodating on getting you your appointments.  The staff is very attentive and helpful. Dr John Williams is wonderful really listens to your needs.  Tried dry needling and it has been very successful for me and I would recommend it for anyone.  This is the only place that I will go for physical therapy.
"Benchmark Physical Therapy (316) has been a wonderful place so far. Everyone is so helpful, attentive & caring. I have been working with JD & he‚Äôs been wonderful in helping me progress with my post-surgical shoulder. The teamwork amongst everyone is awesome as well. I highly recommend this facility!"
"Extremely understanding, Knowledgeable and challenging, my time with Tony and the rest of the staff (especially Alexis) has been well worth it. Over the past several months I have gained strength and confidence to overcome nerve damage in both legs. Now, after hip replacement surgery I have a new challenge and I have confidence the treatment will be successful! Thank you!!
Donna Wood"
"Every minute here in this space was a positive one. The staff, everyone of them, were professional at all levels. Everyone is kind, they pay attention to detail regarding cleanliness, and each patient is given 100%
I highly recommend this facility.."
"Dr. Anna Snyder and the entire staff are amazing, caring, compassionate, and knowledgeable. I went to another physical therapist before coming to Benchmark and I will never use another physical therapist again. Benchmark exceeded my expectations and I am extremely thankful for them. I definitely recommend them."
"The entire Bench Mark staff is wonderful. They are friendly, knowledgeable and genuinely care for their clients. My therapist Anna was super helpful and knowledgeable. I feel that my quick recovery is due to her dedication and expertise. Thank you Anna and everyone at the Dacula Bench Mark location."
Helped me recover from a kneecap issue that had been bothering me for years. Worked with Tony Brown in my sessions. Rest of the staff was cool too.
"Great experience, Anna helped my back pain go away! Thank you so much üòä"
"Great team! Professional, polite, always on point! JD and team care and it shows. :-)"
"Great machine, not like other that don‚Äôt feel balanced. This machine feel perfectly balance for both legs at the same time."
This is a special place. Dr. JD is an elite physical therapist with advanced training and certifications. I highly recommend this wonderful clinic!
"Very nice group of folks to work with. Attentive, caring  and helpful."
"I had physical problems that haunted me for thirty years. I was in poor medical health. I feel so grateful that when I came to Benchmark, my health increased from poor to good. I received all the therapy insurance would pay for in 2020. Now I will wait and see if I can receive more therapy in 2021."
Working with the staff at was enjoyable. Dr. Keller had a plan and it worked well for my shoulder. I'm so appreciative of them.
"I was in pretty bad shape after being in car accident. I could barely turn my head in any direction, hadvnumbness in my feet and hands and the back pain was unbearable.  The treatment that was provided by Megan and the rest of the staff was impeccable. They carefully explained to me the severity of my condition and what each treatment is designed to do to remedy my ailment in this 51yr old body of mine. I'm now pain free thanks to Meg n Bo....I highly recommend u triple Megan's income."
"I‚Äôve had two sessions and so far so good.  Everyone is kind, knowledgeable and professional.  I‚Äôm looking forward to a pain-free future with their help!"
Going there now and I really like it . Everyone is really nice and I enjoy the fact that I do different things almost every time I'm there which is 3 times a week!
"I‚Äôm posting three stars only because they tried to help me.  Back in July while I was removing stripes from my car to prep for a professional paint job I was using 3M Adhesive Remover, which contains Zylene.  Fast forward I was messed up, pointing toward Zylene.  My central nervous system was messed up, difficulty standing, walking, speach, motor skills, and so on.
After going to 3 different doctors, the 4th doctor did tests, yet no one listened to us.  She then referred me to Benchmark to get me back to normal.
Because I was not properly treated by doctors, I was left with not knowing what was really wrong and what I needed help with from Benchmark.
It‚Äôs not there fault.  Hopefully others will get treatment they need at Benchmark.
I appreciate your help and time."
"4 weeks into recovery for bucket handle meniscus surgery and nothing but GREAT things from here! Ian is AMAZING! Friendly and encouraging. Front desk/check in are also super friendly and the other therapists are all warm and welcoming. Hope I never have to come back, but if I do when this is done I know where to come!"






"My experience at benchmark union grove physical therapy was excellent.  I first started my therapy for hip pain with Kelsey then Morgan took over after Kelsey left for other endeavors.  I was extremely pleased and thankful for both therapist for their attention to detail and attentiveness to my needs towards recovery.  I highly recommend them.  And kudos to the staff at front desk, without them scheduling my appointments to suit my busy lifestyle I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to come in for treatment.  Thanks Benchmark, Awesome Job!!  2021‚Ä¶"
I was very weak and having difficulty with simple daily tasks.  The entire staff was pleasant and professional.  Morgan and Alexxis created an environment for me to work hard and see great results.  I would return to this location without reservation.
"Bench Mark at Union Grove was the Best Experience in one of many Recoveries I have ever had. Mike ,the Lead Therapist and Manager is the most Knowledgeable and caring person. Jamie, the Office Manage is the Friendliest, kind and professional staff member I have ever met. Her patience and the respect she gives to people in need is second to none. My daily therapist such as Brandon, Morgan, and Carla Exceed Exceptions in patient care and therapy. I eagerly looked forward to my visits each week.
The Fitness center was clean comfortable and very hygienic. I saw all staff members cleaning and maintaining the highest level of safety during these challenging times we live in. From the time I was check into the facility and greeted with a beautiful smile, to the time I walked out the door, I was treated with respect kindness. I gave full assurance and confidence of my care to Mike and his Great Staff. As a retired law enforcement Officer and now retired airline employee, I exclusively Trust BenchMark with all my physical therapy needs as do my Family, friends and retirees. You will love to hear these words, "" Hi, Welcome to Benchmark"".

Sincerely & Respectfully submitted:

Mark Moore
McDonough, Georgia"
Most folks would hate going to physical therapy but Morgan and her team made things more enjoyable.  Her team are very professional and customized my rehab for a fast return to normal.  I would highly recommend Morgan and her team to anyone.  Thanks Morgan! üíØüíØ
"Michael is wonderful. He knows how to get results without hurting you. He has many methods of therapy to help you.
I have been to him after three different surgeries over several years."
Morgan is awesome! Thank you‚ô°
"John has been amazing with my physical therapy.  I can tell some improvement after just 2 sessions. I'm pretty sure he'll have me back to normal by the time my sessions end. John seems very knowledgeable of exactly what therapy i need. He's friendly and professional.  The entire staff deserves  5 stars, everyone there has been very welcoming and made .e feel comfortable."
"I love this center! I have been to other centers that overbooked patient, so, because they were so busy, I never really got my full hour of therapy. Landon Pack is awesome and so caring. I highly recommend this center and especially Landon Pack."
"After Hip replacement I went to another area PT provider. The staff was nice, but they did a very poor job cleaning during COVID. So I asked my DR. and he suggested I try Emory. The place is CLEAN, the staff is great, and cleans the equipment after every use. John takes the time to explain things, really fine tunes your program and is nice to work with. He works me hard, but I always feel better when I am done.
Some days I am Johns only patient, other days John has one other patient at most. Other places I've been to the PT's have 3>4 patients at a time."
"This is my second experience with Emory Rehab in Griffin, GA and I wouldn‚Äôt think of going elsewhere! Everyone there, from receptionist to the therapists, are extremely professional and helpful.

Landon is my PT. He gives very clear instructions for all my exercises and really puts me through my paces. He answers all my questions, giving detailed explanations. Landon is very personable as well.

I am extremely impressed with all the careful attention the entire staff pays to sanitary issues. They all wear masks and wipe down all the equipment immediately after each use. There are hand sanitizers all over the room and hand washing is strongly encouraged before working out and upon completion of the session."
They are not only competent but genuinely interested in the individual and want to help you improve  your situation. I come here every time I need PT
"The therapists are very skilled and helped me recover from 2 surgeries. My problem is with hygiene during Covid 19. Masks are required. However, people routinely slide them down and let them hang off while working out. Some in the waiting room do not wear them. Patients are not social distancing. With masks pulled down, I feel like I am taking an unnecessary risk. I have asked other patients to pull up their masks. I have asked the therapists to kindly remind the patients, but I am getting tired of being the ‚Äúmask police‚Äù. That should be the job of those running the office.
I am grateful for the help I have received, but I don‚Äôt feel safe."
I have been very pleased with my therapy.  The staff is professional and mindful of my concerns.  The personnel is supportive and eager to work around schedules.  My therapy has been progressive and very effective.  I continue to recommend this center for all rehabilitation needs.
I love going here. John is great. I know I will get better with each visit.
Staff is friendly and therapists have been sensitive to my physical condition.  When I showed up at a wrong time for an appointment they were understanding and did not charge me for the missed visit.  I never have had to wait to start my therapy session. The location is convenient and parking is never an issue.
"Knowledgeable and friendly staff at this facility. John Ellerbee was able to customize a rehabilitation program to fit my specific needs. As a result, I was able to regain strength, and improve my balance and mobility as well. I also observed PT Landon Pack working diligently with his patients to get them back to where they needed to be also. Great team!"
Professional staff who are concerned about my rehabilitation. I enjoy going getting treatments with John who is great.  I love that they have concern for me getting better.
"Landon is very knowledgeable, compassionate and excellent therapist. Like also how flexible the clinic is in arranging appointments."
"Great service, friendly staff. Landon did a great job with getting the tension out of my neck and gave me different exercises to help my neck and keep from having such horrible headaches."
"Landon Pack  is great, he will work with you and get you back going at in no time üëåüèæ"
The staff is very nice. Pushes me to meet my goals.
Wonderful progress; knowledgeable staff; encouraging atmosphere












"Eric Johnson was my therapist.  We are not related.  He was very concerned and very careful as we began working on my issues.  He was thorough.  He was concerned.  And he was friendly.  I feel like he is a friend now.  I highly recommend him.  I didn't get any treatments from Alex, the other technician. but he seemed to have the trust of his patients, as did Eric.  It seemed like I was amongst friends who were concerned about improving my health.  And  Jasmine at the front desk did a good job also.  I felt like they were all my friends.   Eric helped me improve my strength and balance, which I needed.

They put up with my sense of humor, too!"
"Major shout-out to Eric Johnson and his wonderful staff at BenchMark Physical Therapy on Wade Green Road in Kennesaw, GA. I had a serious shoulder issue that resulted in limited range of motion and a ton of pain. I was certain I was destined for surgery. However, Eric thoroughly evaluated my situation and implemented a smart and effective plan that combined in-person treatment with a wide variety of at-home exercises to keep things fresh. I cannot say enough about Eric and his staff‚Äôs professionalism and care as they nursed my shoulder back to health in a relatively short amount of time. If you are in need of PT, this is the place to go. With sincere gratitude, Shawn Butler (Acworth, GA)."
Helped me to regain my confidence so I could get back to living my life.  Appreciated the caring attitude and real interest in my progress. Highly recommend üëå
Really enjoyed the team here. very helpful and taking care of my injury. I appreciate them deeply and highly recommend them!
I worked with Eric Johnson to recover from a broken leg.  He was excellent in helping me.  The staff is very nice and friendly.  Especially Jasmine.
"Eric my physical therapist is a kind, personable, & knowledgeable therapist. Without his help in my rehabilitation after (2) knee replacements I wouldn't be in the great shape I am today. I really can't say enough kind remarks about Eric & staff to adequately show my appreciation. Thanks again!"
Dr. Eric Johnson is very knowledgeable and truly treats you with care.
"I had a great experience with this company, Eric Johnson, who was my physical therapist, is one of the best therapists when I came to therapy, I couldn‚Äôt barely walk as of 8/11/21 I am 100%  back thanks Benchmark."
Eric was awesome and was able to get me back to function normally after a knee replacement! I am greatly appreciative!!!!
I received excellent care from Eric at the Benchmark on Wade Green Road. The staff there is great and it‚Äôs so convenient. Eric took the time to fully discuss my pain and the appropriate care plan. This is the third time over the years that I‚Äôve used Benchmark and each time has been a wonderful experience. Thanks so much Eric for helping me to get pain free!
"I highly recommend Alex for physical therapy. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable about what he does, but he‚Äôs also empathetic towards what you‚Äôre going through. Scheduling is flexible so they are very accommodating to a busy lifestyle. Eric is also a great physical therapist and I recommend him too. The rest of the staff are also very friendly and helpful as well."
"I had an excellent experience with my physical therapist Erik Johnson, PT, DPT.  My 5th metatarsal made my ligaments and tendons stronger after my 8 weeks twice a week therapy.  Erik is very patient with me and he is very professional.  He also provided exercises I could do at home so I can continue after my therapy.  I would recommend this location BenchMark at Wade Green, Kennesaw, GA any time.  The staff are very friendly as well.  Thank you Benchmark."
These people are awesome. Very professional and personable at the same time. My shoulder surgery therapy has been fantastic.
Eric is great. You definitely want him helping you get back to normal.
Had a great first experience and am excited to learn more while helping myself recover.
"Friendly, qualified staff!  Very confident in their rehab abilities."
"I just completed PT with Alex Stephens at the Wade Green office after having rotator cuff surgery. I was very pleased with the results. Alex was instrumental in getting my shoulder back to normal. Should I need PT in the future, I will definitely return!"


I came to Benchmark for physical therapy for a painful frozen shoulder.  I spent 4 months working with Jeff about 2 times per week.  Today I am experiencing no pain and much more range of motion.  Jeff is so knowledgeable and gave me a wide variety of exercises to work through.  He was always asking me questions to find out what was helping and trying new things to make sure we were headed in the right direction.  He is very patient and truly listens to each client to formulate the best treatment plan.  I cannot recommend Jeff enough - he was wonderful to work with and got me back to exercising and living life pain free.
"My father, now 92, suffered a stroke last year which has affected his balance. He now has to use a walker. He received in-home physical therapy for quite awhile but they eventually felt that they had done all they could for him. So, to help improve his gait and address the dizziness he frequently experiences. He began coming to BenchMark Physical Therapy on New Northside Drive. His therapist is Jeff McIntyre and we could not be more pleased with him. On our first visit he spent a good bit of time asking detailed questions about my father‚Äôs condition and symptoms. He was so thorough and caring and based his treatments so that they directly targeted these symptoms. He felt improvement after his very first visit. Jeff was able to explain to us some of the things that are going on with my father of which we were unaware. He is now going for PT with Jeff twice a week and looks forward to those visits. I would highly recommend Jeff McIntyre and BenchMark PT on New Northside Drive. I know you will be very pleased with his professionalism, knowledge, compassion and with the facility itself."
Great location. Easy access to highways. Wonderful friendly staff. Receptionist always greets you with a smile and Jeff is the best. Very personable and seems to understand your pain and goals. After 3 weeks of PT I can truly say I feel and move 100% better than when I started. Keep up the good work Jeff and staff
"Jeff was professional and honest. I started out thinking I had really hurt my hip and was in a lot pain. Jeff was encouraging and worked with me at the right pace. Benchmark should be very proud to have Jeff.
."
"You will not be disappointed if you go see Jeff at Benchmark Sandy Springs. He does a meticulous job of assessing your problem and getting you exactly where you need to be. If you are an athlete of any kind and eager to get back to your sport, quickly but safely, this is where you need to go. Everyone, including the front staff is incredibly nice and during these difficult times, they are taking all the appropriate steps to keep everything well sanitized. I had a great experience here!"
"Caring and Gentle
I just started going to Benchmark Physical Therapy in Sandy Springs and from the moment I walked in the door I felt cared for. Every procedure is thoroughly explained and asking questions is encouraged. I had a shoulder injury from tennis when I first saw Jeff. He has whipped my shoulder back into shape in time for my state tournament! I will continue to see him after I get back too. I feel great every time I walk out the door."
Jeff and his staff was truly amazing. Jeff listened to my concerns and was very hands on every session. The office is very clean and follows Covid19 protocols. All and all very impressed and grateful.
"Therapy at this location is  A1 the physical therapist really listen to understand, the environment is always clean and friendly, I would recommend and seek treatment here in the future if ever needed"
I‚Äôve had such a wonderful experience here! They‚Äôre so friendly and tailor a treatment plan to my specific back needs. They set me up with an app that runs through the daily exercises and I‚Äôm already feeling relief after 3 visits!
Jeff is the best physical therapist I‚Äôve had ever! Always polite! Very knowledgeable! And the best thing was the pace we moved at. Gradually increasing the difficulty of the exercises at a pace that allowed my body to naturally heal as well!
"I broke my Fibula and torn my Deltoid Ligaments and, Jeff McIntyre has helped rehabilitate me back to a normal Life!!
He is a true professional in his field of Physical Therapy.
He is compassionate, knowledgeable, and patient.
I greatly appreciate his bringing me back to excellent health!"
"Jeff is the best! He cares about his patients, listens, and provides excellent PT. I was in an auto wreck and needed PT. Highly recommend!"
Jeff is awesome! Very caring and understanding.

"The entire staff at the Vinings location is amazing! Jenna worked with our daughter to rehabilitate a knee injury over the past 6 months. She is an exceptional therapist who increased our girl‚Äôs mobility and strength. She also bonded with our daughter in a way that made the hard work of rehab fun. Matthew assisted Jenna and is very nice. Donna, a pro in the front office, is one of the nicest people you‚Äôll meet in healthcare. Do yourself a favor and visit PT Solutions in Vinings."
"I choice the location because it was close to my mom . Donna was very helpful  and welcoming on the phone. She made sure my mom paperwork and insurance was correct.  Which made a chore easier.
Jenna the therapist was friendly . She was attentive to my mom needs and listen to make sure that  mom was getting the correct exercise . Which all made it a awesome first day for my mom and me.  Looking forward to returning üòä"
"I am so happy that I chose PT Solutions of Vinings! I have never used physical therapy before so I didn't know what to expect when my doctor suggested it for treatment. But Jenna and the team were super helpful at explaining what would be happening and the possible benefits. I'm happy with my outcome from PT and, while I hope to not need therapy again, I wouldn't hesitate going to back to PT Solutions and Jenna for support."
"Jenna really takes the time to hear out the customers concerns and provides the best steps forward. She was able to evaluate where my pain was coming from and quickly alleviated the pain with her expertise and recommended exercises.

Would recommend to anyone that is willing to follow her advice and follow through with the exercises she prescribes to your recovery plan."
Jenna is one of the best physical therapists around! She‚Äôs thorough and knowledgeable. I came to this clinic with lower back pain and Jenna helped me feel better. I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone looking for a great physical therapy clinic around.
They are the best!  Finished with my shoulder and now starting on my ankle.
"After having three major surgeries in the past , I am no stranger to PT.  My surgeon recommended Benchmark and I was NOT disappointed!  The PT staff is professional and encouraging.  I exceeded expectations!  My doctor said I would never have the range of motion that I had before breaking my arm in three places.  I now have that range of motion!!
The app they provide for at home exercise is great!  I cannot recommend this group highly enough. Thank you Benchmark!"
"My Dr referred me to Benchmark due to long term vertigo. Assigned to PT Conor who was excellent!  Exceeded all expectations.  Very detailed and clarifying every step along the way and explaining exactly what to expect. Follow up was just as thorough. Conor is the consummate professional; proficient, personable, patient, and understanding.  Highly recommend Benchmark, Conor, and an excellent staff."
"Steve Wyandt is a very skilled therapist, and really cares about his patients. Staff is friendly, clinic is very clean. Wonderful experience!"
Extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff. Conor got me playing tennis again when I could barely hold up a racket. Highly recommended.
"Highly recommend this physical therapy facility. Michael Jones is a excellent physical therapist. Thank you, Michael!"
Excellent staff and care by Conner! Extremely willing to go the extra step to help you feel better! Thanks for the personal care and concern and I‚Äôll be seeing you guys after surgery.
"This place knows what time it is.  Conor, who I have been working with as my PT,  is just very good.  Highly recommend."
"Best PT group around! Highly recommend. Skill, compassion and results are second to none.  They exceeded my expectations and my outcome from a complete rotator cuff tear and repair is way beyond anything I expected. They're number one in my book."
"I have intended to write this review for awhile. I was referred here after being in a rear end accident. I found the receptionist to be very helpful and pleasant. And  even though the office is an open floor plan. She is very discrete. Matt is very welcoming, knowledgeable and his approach to treatment is very effective. I like the fact that he works very hard to make the environment comfortable, safe and friendly.. I was really impressed with how well he knows his clients. And he engaged with all of us. I was also very impressed with how Matt was able to seamlessly keep all of us on track with our individual treatment plan. And even though there were more than one client in the space at a time, Matt gave each one of us personal attention. He thoroughly explained our situations and the plan to address it. He was very encouraging and gently firmly pushed us to put in the work to achieve our wellness goals. I am very appreciative to Matt and the staff  for helping me to get through a very painful experience, and the laughs we shared getting there."
"Dr Steve, Connor and the office manager Jennifer were all kind, professional and emphatic. Went in three months ago w arthritis in the knee that forced a noticeable limp and pain, therapy twice a week over the last few months did the trick, muscles surrounding the knee strengthened, pain and limp are gone. Highly recommend this group."
"Dr. Steve conducted PT for my total right knee joint replacement.  The facility was bright, cheerful and organized.  Dr. Steve was extremely knowledgeable, encouraging, and his regimen of exercise helped greatly in improving the strength and stamina of my entire right leg which had atrophied over a 25 year period.  I would highly recommend Dr. Steve's facility and their entire staff for any physical therapy program prescribed by your physician."
"I went from not being able to use my shoulder at all to resuming normal activities in a few weeks, all without pain killers. They were also able to find the source of a previously misdiagnosed injury to my hip. The desk staff was kind and always in a good mood. Anthony was committed, attentive, and professional. He constantly evaluated my progress and was able to push me further each session. I am glad I went directly to Benchmark without a referral!"
Dr. Steve is awesome. He did an excellent job and helped me get stronger faster. Excellent service by staff. I highly recommend them.
"This place is a joke. Zero privacy as the receptionist explained to me and everyone else in the room who my insurance company was, what my deductible was, etc. No ‚Äúopt out‚Äù option if you don‚Äôt want your picture on social media which is a huge concern for me. I‚Äôm in pain and have been referred by my doctor‚Ä¶Not really interested in showing the world my injury with a picture posted on social media. They want you to sign authorization for ‚Äúdry needling‚Äù when you have no idea what that is!  I take my clipboard with all the papers needing my signature and information about the issue and my pain level, etc. and sit down to begin completing all of them. Other than the receptionist, I see someone who must be the physical therapist who is assisting two different people laying on tables when someone walks in and begins telling the physical therapist about someone‚Äôs blind date, how they had to change into a softball uniform to go meet the girl, blah blah, the receptionist joins in on the conversation from across the room and more details about the girl and guy on this date emerge. It was at that point I decided this was NOT the place for me. I question the care the two-people laying on the tables were receiving while this VERY IMPORTANT DATE conversation was taking place. Seriously? Trust me you do not want to be part of this circus. My biggest regret is that I didn‚Äôt take my paperwork with me when I left as who knows what a place like this would do with my address, ssn#, and other personal information."
"Benchmark is the best, especially Matt.  You can tell when you walk in that they care about you and want to help you get better.  I would recommend them to anyone!"


"Justin was my therapist and he did an outstanding job. I had back surgery and was not very active for over six months. With Justin‚Äôs help I‚Äôm back to running 10-12 miles a week and I feel great. He came up with a great recovery plan for me but also listened to what I wanted to do. His schedule was very accommodating. Everyone was great, super friendly and very accommodating. I highly recommend them. Thanks for everything you guys did for me!"
"I have seen Justin at this clinic for a year, and he‚Äôs become my centralized, objective, and main point of contact for my chronic illness. He has been given high marks from multiple high-quality specialists in regards to my improvement, positive demeanor regarding my condition, and my increase in knowledge around health and exercise. Two have even placed my day to day advice, suggestions, and medical needs predominantly into his care, which as we know is a BIG deal for talented specialists to trust others with their patients at this level in someone else‚Äôs hands. With a condition that varies from day to day, Justin develops goals, a multi-tiered plan, and is able to also pivot immediately  when my condition takes an unexpected turn for the good or bad. He has many tools in his resource kit, but even still is nerdy enough to keep up with new research while at the same time isn‚Äôt afraid to ask for advice from a colleague close by. He‚Äôs a patient advocate, answers messages in a timely manner whether he‚Äôs in or out of office, and uses quantitative and qualitative data to drive his practice. All of the staff there works well together, are helpful, and are kind. They have flexible scheduling, are willing to see me in the same day when my body takes a quick turn, and I always see some level of improvement by the end of the session. Every time I end a session with Justin, I leave with next steps and a reassurance that if things don‚Äôt improve he has something else up his sleeve that we can try if needed. I‚Äôm grateful for this practice and for Justin‚Äôs care. I would recommend him to anyone in need of PT for their short or long-term condition."
The environment at this location is incredible! Every team member makes an effort to know each of their clients personally. Justin was my therapist and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for anyone better! He exceeded my expectations of what I thought my physical therapy journey would be. I highly recommend and am more than satisfied with my experience!
The staff at Acworth East location are all very friendly.  Justin was the therapist I mainly worked with. He was very knowledgable and always looking for new exercises that might help me get better. He was not only supportive in my PT journey but also compassionate in my lack of work life balance.
"I came in with a sciatic issue and my therapist is amazing. Keely has shown me so many things to help relieve my pain, even sent me things to do at home in between sessions. So grateful for this place and glad I scheduled with them!"
"Justin and the team at the Acworth location are exceptional. They are out of network for us, but  we wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else. Outstanding knowledge of young athletes and their needs. Highly recommend."
"Professional, always ready at appointment time, focused on what I needed to get back into normal life."
"I had an appointment on June 19th, 2021.  The staff was bubbly and excited.  Unfortunately non of the paperwork was correct.  They claimed to have called my insurance, told me my deductible was over a thousand dollars, that pre-certification was not needed and my copay was between 25 to 75%.  I called my insurance, my insurance card stated I have no deductible and sure enough the company verified this to be true.  Copay is 25% and yes Physical Therapy requires pre-certification.  The manager denied the screw up, but said they would call the insurance company and get the correct information.  To please stay for my 5:00pm appointment.   The young lady that was assigned to me, told me she needed to wait for the manager, before she could start my assessment.   The manager was with his 5:00 pm patient.   While bubbly and sweet is nice, it does get the job done.  It doesn't get the correct information on the patient's paperwork, nor does it get the required pre-certification to the insurance company, and it does not qualify a PT to do their job since obviously she had to have the manager watching over her every move so she could do the job she was hired to do.  Makes me wonder if any of their help besides the manager has  a Physical Theropy Degree much less a state license."
"PT Solutions is a very good physical therapy center. My physical therapist was Justin. He did a great job getting my knee back in shape after I had knee replacement surgery. Justin focused on my weaknesses and chose a series of exercises that got me up and going a lot sooner than I even imagined. There‚Äôs no standing around idle here. Every therapist is busy with a client. The entire staff is dedicated to their work. I have watched them discuss the best exercise for a certain therapy problem, talk to clients with true care and concern, be flexible with times and motivate so that their clients get the best possible outcome from their physical therapy. What makes it even better is that it‚Äôs a happy place. I‚Äôm having my other knee replacement in November, and I have already chosen Justin to be my physical therapist again. I trust him to do what‚Äôs best for my knee and me. I highly recommend PT Solutions Acworth East."
"I'm writing this review on behalf of my 81 year old mother who has been going to PT Solutions Acworth East for the last several months after falling and breaking her right wrist. She's been seeing Justin Youtsey for her therapy. After every session she would tell me how AMAZING he is and how much he helps her. Justin not only helped her recover, but he also motivated and encouraged her when she was doubting her abilities. She just called me so excited saying she graduated from physical therapy today and she feels strong thanks to Justin. She is not fluent with technology, so Justin emailed me ideas of what she can do at home or any equipment that might help to continue her exercises. This is also why I am writing the review instead of her writing it. Thank you Justin for taking such good care of my mother and making enjoyable the experience that she was once worried about. If you are in need of physical therapy, this is the place to go!"
"I called ahead and verified my insurance would be accepted.  However, what they don't let you know is that their contract with Aetna is considered ""Hospital Outpatient"" instead of ""Office"". I was quite surprised when I arrived at the appointment and was informed it would be $376 out of pocket for an appointment that is only $150 anywhere else in the area."
"I feel so lucky to have this facility so close to me. After a car accident and 5 months of chiropractic support, I had to find something else to help me. There was progress but some areas there seemed to be no progress at all. I have had about 4.5 months of weekly sessions with two different therapists at this facility - including virtual appointments for the last month - and I feel so much better! I feel like I am getting my life back now, even though I still have some pain. I now have the therapeutic exercises to keep me going and to continue strengthening. I would highly recommend them!"
I am an  amputee; left leg.  I am receiving excellent physical therapy from PT Solutions.  The staff is well trained as well as personable.  I feel confident that I will achieve my goal of walking and every day functions due to this group of people.
Staff is amazing. They are very professional and really listen to you and take everything you say into consideration when treating you.
"The team at Acworth PT Solutions quickly determined what was wrong with my hip and began treatment immediately.  They took time to listen to me and came up with a plan to help me gain the ability to exercise without pain again. They are very flexible with scheduling. The facility is spotless and the staff is professional, polite and they truly care about me. I highly recommend PT Solutions!"
"I have had neck and shoulder trouble for many years and have gone to various PT and chiropractors. Luckily I was referred to PT Solutions by my Rheumatologist. I have had only a few visits and felt immediate relief on the first visit alone. The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. They pay attention to what I ask and provide great therapy. It's a very clean and comfortable environment and really look forward to my visits. My goal is to be able to play racquetball again and I'm sure I will... What else should a 70 year old retired guy do !
; )"
DO NOT GO HERE. THEY ATTEMPTED TO COVER UP EMPLOYEES TESTING POSITIVE FOR COVID19 AND DID NOT INFORM PATIENTS AND REMAINED OPEN. MY STEP SON AND I WILL NOT BE RETURNING. GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!!!
"I have been to a few of Pt solutions offices and this office is by far my favorite. They have the best aids and most bubbly receptionist, that can just turn your bad day around just walking into the office. I started my journey to recovery out with Jon Gullis and don't get me wrong he was a fantastic pt, but my current pt Gabriella is absolutely phenomenal, she just all around gets me and a lot of the conditions I have going on. This office can be a drive sometimes but it's well worth it for the group that's here. I couldn't be happier!"
"Love this location! I've gotten to work with Jon and Millie, both of whom are tough and demanding, but they are also encouraging and want you to do well. I definitely highly recommend this PT Solutions to anyone in need of PT! Everyone is friendly and calls you by name when you walk in the door."
"My experience with PT solutions has been excellent.  The staff is competent , courteous, professional and caring. I have learned a lot from them as far as improving my physical well being with therapy. I am grateful for the excellent care I am receiving. A big Thank You to all . Regards"
My grandmother fell down the stairs and nobody helped her up she was injured somebody that I helped her but they choose not to
"Fantastic therapists, super friendly and helpful staff, convenient scheduling. Love this place!"
They go above and beyond with each patient. Plus they always find a way to make PT fun for everyone. It makes us want to come back excited to keep going.
"I am very happy with the results I have received from PT Solutions.  The staff is very professional, courteous and friendly.  I have recommended PT Solutions to my pain care doctor Krool Care, Dr. Cox and he was very receptive.  I give PT Solutions 5 Stars and wouldn't hesitate to give more if I could.  If you need physical therapy please see PT Solutions, you will be amazed.
."
The customer service here is excellent! The staff there are a pleasure to be around and make physical therapy much more enjoyable. The PTs there are knowledgeable and truly care about the patient and their rehab.
"I love this place.  I used them in 2010 and then again this year.  The therapists are extremely knowledgeable, empathetic and helpful.  I wholeheartedly recommend PT Solutions."
"Great facility, good location - easy to access. Staff with extensive knowledge and very friendly. I would recommend this location to everyone üëçüëçüëç"
I love the care and staff here. I consistently get the care I need and they are super personable. I highly recommend them for all ages.

The staff here are very courteous and care about their patients and very professional GREAT SERVICE !!

"From falling in racetrack in a split hurting my groaning and back I came to pt solution Highly  recommended! Staff is great very friendly kind . They are a1 to get you back going . I love gabby , Caroline, morrow and the assistants."
"The staff is top notch, they care about you and try to actually know you and your situation."
"The service is excelent, they are very professional and very friendly. I do not like to go to any rutinary medical service, but it is diferent with PT Solutions Acworth East. I try not to miss any of my appointments. I see Immediate results and I have made quick progress. There are no words to thank the staff."
First time here and so far it‚Äôs the best PT I‚Äôve been to.
"Very friendly staff!! Nice facility! Great place, highly recommend!"
"I highly recomment PT Solutions at 3540 Cobb Pkwy in Acworth. All the therapists have been extremely friendly and professional in their treatment, and they get results. They treat you not as a number, but as a friend."
Very knowledgeable staff very clean facilities
Awesome folks! Southern hospitality on steroids!!!
"very nice staff, very clean facility."
"The staff is very knowledgeable, skillful, professional, and compassionate."
"Friendly, caring, knowledgable staff."
Outstanding!!üòä  My hip is Better!


















"Went a while ago for a shoulder problem. Nice staff, but I was double charged for my PT. It would have cost me hundreds if I hadn‚Äôt noticed and my insurance had charged me the extra. It definitely could have been an honest mistake. If that‚Äôs the case PT solutions, please be more careful with your billing or possibly switch your billing contractor.
Anyway, if you go here for PT watch out to make sure your bill checks out."
I‚Äôve had a great experience with Chase at this location. He goes out of his way and puts a plan together that makes sense and that I feel comfortable with. He has a genuine interest to get me back up to full speed and has the know how to make it happen. Thanks Chase!
"PT Solutions of Watkinsville is the best. Easy to work with and schedule, quick to respond and the PTs are awesome. Hopefully I will not need them again but if I do I know where I am going."
"Chase has been my physical therapist for almost 5 years and he has been the best one I have ever had. When he moved offices I still chose to go see him because I didn‚Äôt trust anyone else to work on my back. He has been there for me and helped me through multiple athletic injuries over the years. He was also my mentor during my internship at his office, so I got to see what it was like to be on the providers side as well. Chase is very thorough and was not afraid to tell me if I was doing something wrong, and I didn‚Äôt feel as if I couldn‚Äôt ask him any questions. He was always willing to help me, and to this day when I‚Äôm not in pt I can still go to him and ask him questions. I highly recommend Chase and his staff for any of your physical therapy needs."
I was in need of Physical Therapy and due to a family member and myself being extremely high risk for COVID-19 I felt it was too risky to go to a PT facility for treatment.  I was referred to PT Solutions of Watkinsville for virtual treatments. I have had two appointments virtually and I am so grateful to be getting service from them. My PT instructor explained and demonstrated every exercise thoroughly and how each would benefit me.  I am feeling so much better after two visits and am looking forward to continued visits.  I highly recommend PT Solutions of Watkinsville to anyone who needs this type of service.
I have had a great experience with Chase at PT Solutions Watkinsville. He really cares about his patients- the whole person.  We are working together to improve my bone spur problem! Emma also is a great person to greet us when we arrive.
Chase has worked on both of my kids several times for various sports injuries. He always makes them feel welcome. They actually enjoy going to ‚Äúthe doctors office‚Äù now!
"I have had a great experience with PT Solutions of Watkinsville. I highly recommend them for your physical therapy needs. Very knowledgeable personnel, coupled with concentrated one-on-one care makes for an outstanding PT experience."
"PT Solutions and their team in Watkinsville are at the top of their game.  Don't let the perception of a ""chain"" clinic deter you as it first had for me.  Chase and Lauren are knowledgeable, professional, attentive, and will provide you the best care you could possibly receive.  They will work closely with you in their clinic and provide you exercises for at-home, with a plan to return you to mobility as quickly as possible.

After working with Chase, he will be my go-to with any injuries in the future, with or without a physician's prescription.  More people should be receiving Physical Therapy for common injuries and this has to be the most underappreciated medical profession that exists.  I don't look forward to being injured in the future, but I do look forward to working with Chase again, if I am."
Chase is the best! I always enjoy seeing him for physical therapy! Go see him!
Very pleased with Dr. Chase and the team at PT Solutions. Provided great care and results.
Have started pt with pt solutions and I am very pleased with the services. I am doing my therapy at home and has worked out great.
My husband saw Chase for PT at PT Solutions and had great results! Awesome facility!
Have a serious problem with my pirroformis muscle and the team at PT did not cure but gave me great advice in stretching and rolling on lacrosse ball. I highly recommend PT Solutions team anytime.
Amazing people all around. My dad is SO grateful. I can't recommend them enough.
"I highly recommend PT Solutions in Watkinsville!   They took such great care of me.   They are kind, courteous, professional, and excellent.   I quickly recovered from the condition I went in for.    I would definitely go back if I needed Physical Therapy."
Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better place to have your PT!! Chase and staff are all wonderful!!
"Chase is awesome. He really listens to your issues and does a great job! I highly recommend him and this location in Watkinsvile, GA"
They have provided excellent care for my daughter after her knee surgery. Very good service and great people.
I am very impressed with PTSolutions. They were most helpful in signing me in. They were clear about how my PT would progress. The greatest part was the one-on-one care that I got. That was special. The place was clean and neat. I loved the two appointments that I have had with Jamie and Kylie. They are excellent and most likable!!!
"The staff is very friendly!  They take the time to get to know you and understand everything that is going on with you not just the injury your being seen for.  They take that into account when helping you thru your therapy.  As a vet, I was able to utilize PT Solutions thru the VA which was an enormous help.  I would recommend Kacey Young to anyone that asked.  She is truly professional and caring person.

Howard Snyder"
"Clean facility with a friendly, knowledgeable staff. Highly recommended!"
So thankful for a top-notch PT office in Watkinsville. Looking forward to continuing PT for my knee with PT Solutions! They also took great care of our son after a youth sports injury. We are fans of PT solutions!
"I hada great experience with PT Solutions.  The staff are wonderful, friendly, and encouraging.  They were very flexible with my schedule.  I would recommend PT Solutions to anyone who needs physical therapy."
I noticed improvements almost immediately. They are very knowledgeable. The staff is friendly and fun to talk to. I‚Äôm very happy that I‚Äôll be going back after my ACL reconstruction surgery.
Great place for all your physical therapy needs. I was there for shoulder therapy. Casey is a go getter!!!! She gets the job done. They worked around my schedule too.
"Great place to go. Jamie is amazing. She's friendly, very knowledgeable, and willing to work with other medical professionals to maximize your rehab."
"PT people are great, especially Mrs Kacey Smith who helped during my first session. She was helpful, patient with me"
Very kind and knowledgeable therapists who are dedicated to seeing optimal results. Love this place!
Amazing staff. Appointments are fun and don't feel like work.
You will not be disappointed with PT Solutions!  Kacey and Lindsay make a great team!
"I am a huge fan of PTSolutions Watkinsville, GA! I have tarsel tunnel in my heel and was having a lot of discomfort. Kacey, Odell, and Juliene all helped in caring for me with the sole purpose of getting me back to the activity level I desired and was missing out on due to pain. Kacey and Odell are very knowledgeable and were very good at putting things into layman‚Äôs terms to help me understand what was going on with my heel and what they were doing to help me get better! But the best part is their method. They are welcoming, personable, fun (even while making me workout), creative, and passionate! Juliene dry needled me and was calming the first time. She did a great job putting my fears of those little needles at rest. It was very beneficial to my healing process!
Each time I walked in I was met by Lindsey at the desk with a big smile and a how are you this morning and then have a great day as I left! She was very welcoming and helpful as well!
Honestly, I feel like I came away from therapy not only with my heel feeling much better but also having gained new friends! Kacey, Odell, Lindsey, and Juliene are awesome people and therapist! Thanks guys for getting me back in the game!"
"friendly, helpful and knowledgeable people. I'm having good results."
"The staff is professional, great listeners, efficient, knowledgable & kind.  I seriously would not go elsewhere!"
They make me feel comfortable.
Kacey Young is so professional and kind. Glad I found PT Solutions.
"Very professional, courteous, and friendly."
great
Good








Dr Dean is an extremely knowledgeable and kind therapist. He has helped me tremendously through my surgeries and the recoveries that have followed them. He stays up to date on the most effective treatment techniques and has the best equipment to go along with that. You‚Äôll be in good hands if you come to Achieve PT!
"I've been to Achieve Physical Therapy for 2 different issues- post knee surgery and a neck issue.  Both times were seamless from the front desk to the actual treatment.  Dr. Dean doesn't over book you like the chain PT companies do.  He devotes time to you as an individual and isn't distracted by many other patients at the same time. He also keeps things fun and lively- you will not be bored and most likely there will be some fun and laughter involved, but he is very serious about his patients well being."
"Knowledgeable, friendly and local staff. Great location! Dr. Dean is great with patients of all ages and uses his witty nature to help you through the discomfort. I would recommend them to anyone!"
"Great place. Doc is knowledgeable and motivating. I was able to make real improvements with the exercises we did. Staff is nice, flexible with their hours."
Awesome staff. Great place to receive physical therapy.

"I've been going to PT at this location since my shoulder replacement surgery and have had a great experience.  I started out with Baabak as my therapist and then when he transferred to another location, Kristin took over my care.  Both of them are extremely qualified, professional, and personable.  I would recommend the crew there without reservation."
"Professional, caring staff. Caleb, Kristen and associates are the best in their professions. Friendly, connected health care professionals who truly care about their patients."
"I was impressed by the facility, didn‚Äôt even realize it was there, tucked away near 285. Friendly staff, not too big, my therapist was very knowledgeable and helpful."
"I have been going to this location on and off for various PT needs.  They are professional, friendly, and you feel better when you leave physically and with a smile on your face.  Great people!!"
Good experience and highly recommend.
"Bad experience with PT Kristen, very rude didn't want to hear what I had to say about my condition, she more concerned about being right than my healing.  Also very condescending when I mentioned about holistic care from a chiropractor."
"My husband has been coming to Benchmark twice a week for over a month for outpatient physical therapy after suffering a spinal cord injury from a fall last October.  He is slowly regaining use of his hands and legs.  Each visit he is aided and encouraged by several therapists for about an hour and one-half with several different exercises.  He is walking longer with use of walker, his shoulder is not as painful and stiff, his balance is improving.  All the staff are exceptional and caring and friendly.  One of them always meets us at the door and helps guide wheelchair over door ledge both as we come in and as we leave.  We highly recommend this group."
"My experience at BenchMark has been nothing but AMAZING the last few months! The staff is super friendly & happy all the time. They're team work & energy makes you forget you're there for physical therapy. And a huge thanks to Hannah for her patience
& getting me through!!"
I started PT at Benchmark because of a shoulder issue.  They have taken such good care of me in the few weeks that I‚Äôve been going!  My shoulder is much better and I‚Äôm planning to go back for my neck issues that weren‚Äôt helped at all at another PT facility.
"I honestly don't know where to begin to express my heartfelt gratitude for this group of phenomenal people at this Benchmark location. I am so grateful for these wonderful people and their level of care and compassion they give me each week. True professionals in every sense of the word. Hannah, Joshua,  Kristen and if I left a name out forgive me HUGE thank you for all you do!! I look forward to my visits there and the smiling faces!

With great appreciation,
Susan Wallace"
"Everyone here is so nice and helpful!! It‚Äôs my second time back, different group besides Kristen and I love them just as much!! ‚ù§Ô∏è I HIGHLY recommend this place if you need a place for physical therapy, they make you feel like family."
"What a caring team Benchmark has assembled here! They are personable and are concerned for speedy recovery. Highly recommend, you can‚Äôt go wrong here."
I would definitely recommend Benchmark for any kind of physical therapy. The staff is always very friendly and helpful. Also Kristen is a great therapist. I will certainly use them for all my physical therapy needs. There are wonderful.
"I would highly recommend Benchmark for Physical Therapy. The staff is very friendly and always greets you with a smile. Kristen is very friendly, knowledgeable and shows genuine concern for you. I also don't know how she always remembers what's going on in your life from one week to the next!"
I have had the best experience here! Everyone is super nice and I feel like my voice gets heard! I won‚Äôt ever see another office.
I had a great experience with Benchmark Cartersville. All the staff is extremely kind and helpful. My technician Hunter explained every thing so well and took good care of me while I was there.
"The staff at Benchmark are all caring and attentive. I‚Äôve gotten a great massage from Kristen and Hannah .They all work as a team to ensure my needs are met. I‚Äôve never sat, waiting , hoping they haven‚Äôt forgotten me.!  Thanks to Hunter for keeping my session moving along and the loveable patience of Josh when I‚Äôve had to change my appointments .Each visit feels like I‚Äôm dropping by to see good friends.  Jewell Talsma"
"Best place to recover! I have been in
other PT places, but this location is the best üëç"
"I have been coming to Benchmark in Cartersville for about a month and a half now. I cannot express how wonderful every employee in this building is. Regardless of how many patients they see each week, they remember your name, what you have going on in your life, and exactly what your treatment is. Hannah and Kristen are absolutely wonderful and I have never left wishing they had done more. I had the option to switch to a location closer to my work but said absolutely not! I‚Äôm sure the other locations are just as nice but I can‚Äôt imagine being treated anywhere other than this particular location with this amazing staff! If anyone has the opportunity to select where to receive their physical therapy, I highly recommend Benchmark in Cartersville!"
Bench is the best!   Hunter and Hannah are excellent.  I love BENCHMARK!
"Friendly and super helpful, they really work with you!
I feel 100%
Thank you"
Extremely competent staff!! Very knowledgeable and genuinely concerned about your success in therapy. Ms Hannah works hard to help my daughter succeed!
Very professional director and  staff. Every patient is treated with outmost respect and they know their work. They try to meet the needs of each patient. I appreciate their work and l love to be treated by benchmark staff in Cartersville. They are the best . The director is awesome too.
Kristen Fraley is an amazing therapist and made a huge difference in my recovery from major back surgery.
Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Surpassed my goals with their help.
"I am beyond happy with my experience at Benchmark PT in Cartersville! I am so grateful to Kristen for everything she has done for me. All the ladies working there are so personable, and kind. It was truly a joy to see them every week!"
"Have been extremely pleased. They are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable."
Great People and Great at what they do!
"I can‚Äôt brag on this place enough. The girls at Benchmark are professional, they care and they know their stuff. I walked in as a stranger and now as I slowly finishing up my therapy, they‚Äôve become people I‚Äôve come to love. Best Benchmark in the South!!"
"I had to use my daughters account because google wouldn‚Äôt let me sign in. Let me start by saying I‚Äôve had injuries earlier in my life that required physical therapy and Benchmark in Cartersville is the best I‚Äôve ever been to.   The staff at Benchmark are very knowledgeable, personal, caring, helpful, easy to talk to and genuinely care about your health and recovery. I have and will continue to recommend them.

Thanks for all of your help,

Ken Godfrey"
"Dr. Heather did a magnificent job guiding my recuperation from ankle reconstruction surgery. Great listener, skilled, understanding and very professional. What a team, all these ladies work together so well, that I remarked several times how difficult it is to put together a group of five people with their synergy being greater than the sum of its parts. I will be forever grateful to Heather, Mary Fran, Kristen, Kayla and Stephanie for the professional kindness and respect demonstrated toward me. Thank you!"
"The staff at Benchmark are incredibly nice and always professional! They‚Äôve always made me feel welcome, almost like home. They helped relieve my back and neck pain easily!! I would definitely recommend them to ANYONE that needs physical therapy."
"Awesome, caring staff!!!"
Very personable. Very considerate. Takes time to really listen to you. The doctors are awesome! Overall amazing experience!
"I want to give a shout out to Kristen Fraley, Pt and the staff at Benchmark for their excellent care I received after my rotator cuff  surgery.
I would highly recommend  Benchmark Physical Therapy to anyone that
needs physical therapy.
They are professional , very  caring , knowledgeable,  and friendly.
Thanks to all at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Cartersville ."



"Highly recommend this place! The environment is always so welcoming and caring. Always loved being greeted right when you walk through the door! As a nurse who leads a strenuous work ethic, a knee injury is never a good sign. After a few sessions here I started to feel stronger and increased flexibility in my knee. Charetta was amazing! She always listened to what seemed to be bothering my knee, and always had a solution! I am so appreciative of the Benchmark- Briarcliff staff, and I am happy to say that my knee has returned to baseline!"
"This is the first time I‚Äôve ever gone to physical therapy. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. My left knee had been bothering me for some time. The orthopedic doctors told me over the years ‚Äúyou have arthritis and will need a knee replacement eventually‚Äù. In other words, just live with the pain until you can‚Äôt. That wasn‚Äôt really an acceptable option to me. I asked my primary doctor for a referral to PT. That connected me to Cheretta. She is so skilled in her job. I went from being unable to walk to the end of my block to now being able to walk for miles, ride a bike, etc. I have my life back. This was worth the time. Thank you so much for the care."
"Highly recommend these guys! I had surgery on my foot and I wasn‚Äôt able to do anything, so my doctor recommended physical therapy. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect but I was eager to get back to normal. When I first hobbled in, I was cheerfully greeted by Alexis and then Charetta began my treatment program. Over the weeks I saw both Charetta and Payne and I began to make a lot of progress. Now I‚Äôm able to walk without any problems and I even began hiking again. If it wasn‚Äôt for the team (Charetta, Payne, and Alexis) I would still be struggling. I‚Äôm extremely happy with every aspect of my treatment plan and know I would not be where I am today without their help and guidance. I cannot say enough about how much they have helped me get my life back to normal! They are truly the best of what‚Äôs around!"
"My orthopedic recommended Benchmark after a knee injury.  I had experiences in the past with physical therapy, but nothing came close to the personalized, professional services provided by Charetta Oliver, who is also the Clinic Director at this location.
From the time I first hobbled in, to when I literally side-stepped out of the place at the end of my last session, Ms. Oliver guided me to recovery, tailoring my PT to better assist me in being able to complete my physical work tasks after I left my sessions.
I started looking forward to my sessions with each improvement.
Ms. Oliver is just brilliant at responding to her clients, being ever vigilant and correcting bad form, and encouraging good, positive attitudes.  She worked wonders with my pessimistic disposition and physical uncoordination.  I learned a great deal and can still hear her voice when I walk, concentrating on good form and now am less prone to injury.
This location is immaculately clean and super-friendly.  Alexis, who has a great sense of humor, manages the office and is ever helpful to clients and co-workers alike.
You cannot help but notice how everyone is treated with respect and provided unrelenting encouragement.
Do not hesitate to make an appointment here should you need physical therapy.  You will definitely be in great hands!"
People are great and fun. Love the clean atmosphere. Let this be your place for your physical therapy needs
"Charetta Oliver DPT is awesome because I have felt better every since I started and completed therapy I think Charetta knows her craft, well. Alexis is also very personable and handles the front and back office very well she is a solid performer in my view I definitely recommend this office"
"I had an amazing physical therapy experience at BenchMark Physical Therapy! Ethan was awesome at informing me of how the different techniques and exercises were improving my injury. Alexis, the officer manager was amazing at helping me understand my insurance deductibles and payments for my appointments. There were no surprises! This location have awesome, flexible hours that are manageable with my work schedule. More than anything, I've had great results with the healing of my neck injury and it was a fun environment. Highly recommend!"
"Charette, Alexis, and Payne were simply amazing! Such a warm, inviting environment with amazing folks who knows their stuff! Glad I ended up at this location!"
"Great service and attention to detail. They truly show love and appreciation to their customers at the newly opened Decatur location, they are very hands on regarding your specific needs and ensure your success in your healing process. Please go see Krysta, Cheo and Bianca for great care. I highly recommend their location for awesome care."
"I absolutely loved this place! Ethan is very good with his patients. The customer service was amazing and the quality of the therapy is very great too!! They have good resources for pain management, stretches and strengthening exercises to do at home!  I wouldn‚Äôt have made the progress i made anywhere else. :)"
"This place is absolutely wonderful! I came in limping and left feeling stronger than I‚Äôve ever felt! The staff is all so kind and incredibly talented. Khoi, Ethan and Alexis are not only extremely helpful, but they are also  genuinely good people. They cater to your specific injury and challenge you every session (in the BEST way). This is THE PLACE to go for physical therapy! :)"
"After a car accident I was sent by my doctor to Benchmark Brighten Park.I found the staff there very helpful and knowledgeable.

I worked the program they planned for me and gradually my focus came back and my body started to heal from the injuries. They were very patient with me and gave me various exercises to do at home, also

Ethan Jackson and Khoi Nyguyen both trained me on the exercises and their styles complimented each other. I had to do the work to get well, but it was worth the time and effort."
"Ethan Jackson is a rock star! I went into BenchMark Physical Therapy after surgery with a prescription for PT. I had several issues going on that were causing me a lot a pain and weakness. Ethan was patient, knowledgeable, and the key force in my recovery.  He is an outstanding PT and one that I would highly recommend to anyone. Alexus at the front was also patient and tenacious with my insurance company and scheduling. Kudos to Ethan for giving me my life back without pain!"
"I highly recommend Ethan Jackson. I feel great now, and I didn't before."
Ethan was a joy to work with and I truly appreciate his  push to get me back to working standards. I would recommend anyone to go see Dr. Jackson to get better physically. Awesome experience!
"Ethan is amazing! He is very supportive, all while challenging me to become better. His help was vital to my quick recovery."
"I have been to Ethan with therapy for my neck, my lower back, and my elbow. With each situation, he resolved the issues. I have requested for the second and third situation to return to Ethan. He is very professional and attentive. He listens and is willing to address all questions. I appreciated how thoroughly he could educate me in home exercises. Marion was also always very kind and willing to help with any change I needed to make. It was always a pleasure seeing both of them. I plan to return as the need may arise."
"Ever since I started therapy over at Benchmark, Ethan has been exceptional at helping me to get better. When I initially came in, I was having major issues with my neck and back due to an automobile accident. After successfully going through the sessions and doing those stretches at home, I was finally able to get my muscles back in order. I definitely recommend to anyone that needs PT. Thanks again for the help. You guys are awesome."
"I attended physical therapy sessions here 2x/week for 19 weeks mostly with Ethan Jackson, and periodically with Dominik Shannon. I've had physical therapy elsewhere and I can honestly say both of these guys are great! They helped me recover nicely from both a shoulder and a knee injury that I acquired in the same accident. They are knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions. They, along with the receptionist Marion, have positive attitudes and are very kind. I always felt very welcomed there. I enjoyed being there and will go back, if necessary, in the future."
"Ethan Jackson was my therapist and he was amazing.  Great guy to work with and very skilled.  He took me from crutches to zero pain and a full range of motion in an unexpectedly short amount of time!  Hopefully won‚Äôt need PT again, but if I do, this is absolutely where I will go."
I have been to a few physical therapist in Atlanta and found Benchmark by far the best. From making appointments to sessions the entire staff is incredibly knowledgeable and professional. They are thoughtful and informative. I never felt like just another number/patient. I highly recommend them for your rehabilitation. They truly care about each patient.
I went to Dr. Ethan Jackson for a torn meniscus and patella tendinitis in my right knee. I opted for physical therapy rather than surgery. I have always been involved in athletics and needed specific treatment. Dr. Jackson developed a rigorous tailored plan to get me back in the gym. He‚Äôs knowledgeable and persistent. I will be going back to Dr. Jackson for all my physical therapy. I‚Äôll recommend him for anyone in need of proper care for all physical therapy needs.
"Every person in this location was friendly, professional, and personally caring with great results for me! I limped in their door and 5 monts later walked out without any pain! I highly recommend their services."
"My PT was Ethan Jackson and - in addition to being a genuinely nice guy who's easy to talk to - he was extremely helpful and effective in guiding my rehabilitation after I injured my back.  He established a feasible at home plan and supplemented with weekly sessions and I'm now fully recovered.  His office was very easy to work with, accomodated multiple changes to my schedule, and I was able to get in and see him for treatment much faster than if I'd attempted to use the in house PT at the doctor's office. I'd highly recommend this office."
I had a great experience. Scheduling was easy and Dr. Jackson and his team we‚Äôre very professional. Great quality of care and service experience.
"Ethan Jackson is fantastic. Attentive, keeps his cool at all times, and engaging. Very happy with my therapy."
Great place . Exceptional care from Ethan Jackson. highly recommended.  Miriam‚Äôs great at front desk check in too.
"This location has some of the best therapists, I worked with Ethan Jackson for a short while and he was excellent, he was able to pinpoint my issues and they were quickly resolved within a few visits. I recommend Ethan and Benchmark to anyone who needs physical therapy."
Went in with a shoulder/back/nerve problem. Acupuncture couldn‚Äôt quite fix it but Ethan did. Him and Mirian are awesome!
Ethan and Miriam are both extremely professional and patient. I found my pt was always conducted with as little stress as possible.
Great place. Got my arm working!
Perfect care great customer service

"Everyone at Benchmark Physical Therapy is a highly qualified part of an expert team.  The care I have received has been outstanding.  Dr. Davis is kind, patient, and knowledgeable beyond reproach.  I have no doubt that when I am finished with my PT, I will be 100%.  Amber at the front desk is warm, welcoming and always takes time to meet your needs.  This is absolutely the best place to seek physical therapy."
"I went in unable to do anything thing at all without feeling severe pain and in the few appointments that I‚Äôve already had I‚Äôm able to do more. Although small, I am grateful to be able to do anything at this point. My physical therapist is very professional, thorough, and compassionate. She is great at what she does and I can tell that she loves what she does. I know that once my treatments are done I will be back to my old self again. Thank you so much!üòÄ"
Walking in the door was always a good kind greeting by the front desk. Temperature and masks never forgotten even when several patients were there. Very impressive and safe. The office is excellent in professionalism and courtesy. My care was tailored to my specific pain and need and I no longer need my cane for every step and my balance has so much improved. I feel so much better with the BenchMark PT and stronger. Appreciated
After being in a terrible wreck and not hardly being able to do anything on my own I was paired with Alex Davis. The guy is great the way he shows he cares for his patients and his positive attitude makes you really feel like you‚Äôre at home. Such a great environment to be in with great people.
"This was my first experience with physical therapy. I think y'all were very professional and care for your patience, I would definitely recommend to friends and family. Thank y'all."
"From  my first  interaction at the front desk,  I felt welcomed and completely at ease.  After several visits with all of your  therapists,  I  found them to be second to none. They are equally professional,  knowledgeable, and effective.  I would  highly recommend this place to everyone of any age.  They are all very accommodating to my schedule and needs.  The world could learn from them how  to treat people!"
"The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable, encouraging and helpful. Will definitely go back if I need more therapy."
BenchMark of Brunswick has been great for my son. He had a torn ACL from football and had a major surgery to repair it. They have worked with him through each step of the healing phase and push him just a little each time. Alex is very attentive and personable and makes our son feel so comfortable and his confidence is growing daily. Alex has been a pleasure to work with. They are always so very nice when I call or when we come in for appointments. Kiersten does a good job picking up where left off if for some reason Alex is not available. I would recommend BenchMark of Brunswick to any parent or family member that needs Physical Rehabilitation. There is no doubt in my mind that my son will make a full recovery with the use of his leg. I truly believe his leg will be stronger than ever. They sure have put this mamas worries to rest. Thank you BenchMark for all you do for my son. He can‚Äôt wait to run again!! ü§£
"If you are ever in need of physical therapy this is the place to visit. My wife and I are both out of this world happy with the treatment and caring they have shown us. The staff is amazing Britney, Amber and many others but specially Dr. Kyrsten Dowling has treated us like family. Her vast knowledge has nursed us back to health in no time and has made the experience filled with joy with her undying love of her patients.

The cleanliness is impeccable, the service is outstanding and the air is charged with positive energy.

Thank you from the bottom of our hearts !!!"
"My experience with Benchmark Physical Therapy in Brunswick has been nothing short of AMAZING.

Brooke was wonderful!! I would highly recommend anyone to see ya'll.  Thanks so much!!
"My 10 year old granddaughter was prescribed physical therapy for a hairline lower back fracture.
Allen was her therapist.  He was so good with Kate.  Not only in her PT care but also getting to know her and having her openly engage with him .  It made her time healing better and it seemed to go faster.
Thank you to the staff at Benchmark for making this child's journey a good one."
"The whole team at Benchmark is fantastic! Friendly, helpful, and Caring. Alex is Great with me and all his clients. He is truly a team player!

Then when I walked into the buisness I was quickly greeted by two very professional ladies whom working at the reception desk and they helped me and walked me through the paper work. Then I met my Physical Therapist Mr. Alexander Davis he was and has been very professional and patient with me. Overall Ive been very impressed with BenchMark Physical Therapy, Brunswick Ga"
"Benchmark Physical Therapy was wonderful.  My therapist worked with me over multiple sessions.  She was so kind and knowledgeable, adapting to my situation as we went.  I'm not always the easiest patient to figure out.
I've regained a lot of movement that I had previously lost.  Thank you!"
"I started going to physical therapy at benchmark for chronic back and neck pain. I found the facility to be clean, quiet, and a little fun! Brooke , my therapist, listened compassionately to my problems and set out to create a plan for me. I have seen a decrease in pain and an increase in mobility since starting my regimen. I actually look forward to going to physical therapy because I can tell it works.  I highly recommend benchmark physical therapy in Brunswick, Georgia."
"The first time i started Bench Mark Physical Therapy the staff there were were very friendly starting from the young ladies, the receptionists there then to the therapist. They answered every question that i asked, also has empathy for all the clients there. This is the first time i ever been to any places where everyone is friendly, everyone of them from the time i started until know still the same with a Great attitude, they treat everyone that comes in there the same. My physical therapist Kyrsten Dowling is wonderful, she patient, understanding, caring, and has empathy. I would recommend BenchMark."
Awesome place to have PT. The therapists are very professional and truly care about your well being. The office staff is very helpful and friendly too.
"‚ÄúHeart Of A Champion ‚Äú

At first I was scared and afraid to perform the activities of therapy because of my injuries, was to scared I would fall but all of the staff at Benchmark made me feel comfortable and welcome and let me know I can do all things I put my mind to so til this very day I still love them and visit them like family for getting me back to myself and on track with confidence.

My special thanks to Amber, who runs the office and keeps things running smoothly, and my therapist Tony Scherpenseel.  It is apparent that Tony is genuinely concerned for my well being and is always challenging my with new ways to improve.  Thanks!"
I have had therapy all over town. This is by far the best I have ever received. From the front desk to the therapist. I could not lift my arm because my shoulder hurt so bad and now I have complete movement. The equipment is first class and there is plenty of it. Please consider BenchMark for your Physical Therapy needs.
"I have attended Benchmark Physical Therapy in Brunswick before and after my cervical spine surgery. All of the physical therapists are very attentive, caring, thorough, professional, polite and communicate very well with your doctor(s). The ladies up front are so warm and friendly. They welcome you everytime with a smile, answer the phones and return message in a timely manor and really take the time to relate with the patient's while in the waiting area. I would highly recommend this facility for anyone with physical therapy needs."
All the people are nice and they all care about you and your Medical problems and how you feel
We are a local team of compassionate physical therapists who will listen and work tirelessly to help you get back in the game of life!
I have been in countless accidents and have seen a countless number of physical therapist...(I guess I'm accident-proned). But I have never received such great hands on care as I have from them. Miss Tonya is THE BEST. Great people which makes a great environment.

I had A total knee replacement. First day I came in I Waited over 25 minutes just to see my therapist. Every time I came in to Physical therapy Jason Martin was always with Another patient. I was always pushed to the side and never got one on one Therapy from him.But what I did notice is every time I came in he was giving all his time to other clients. Very upset with his Services that I paid good money for and never received.   I have been going Benchmark PhysicalTherapy for over 5 years and Within that 5 years He has been the absolutely worst therapist I've ever had !!!
Great place to get a complete Physical  Therapy  recovery and the staff is very personable and highly knowledgeable in their field of Physical Therapeutics.   üôÇ
"Benchmark you are the best.  After several weeks of therapy I heightened my mobility, lost eleven pounds, reduced my A1C one full point and improved blood pressure.

DEE AND JASON YOU ARE MY HEROES!!!!!

Thank you
Ed Watson
Commerce"
"Friendly staff, and works well together to help each other..."
Staff here is great! Don't know how I'd be able to use my shoulder without their help.
What to thank the staff at BenchMark for the great service I received during my knee recovery.. You are a super staff made my recovery so much better.

"Words can not  adequately explain the gargantuan impact that Phillip Kellogg & his team have had on my life!!  Being able/allowed to run today, after not being able to for years, and even though it was just a little, did worlds of good for my confidence...a confidence that I have lacked for many years."
"Spencer Baron is an incredible physical therapist. He helped me get past chronic pain that affected my quality of life, and taught me how to keep the pain at bay in the future. I strongly and wholeheartedly recommend PT Solutions of Decatur!"
Physical therapist are excellent!  Friendly staff that encourage you.  You will be in excellent hands.
"Saw PT Solutions for a grade 2 ankle sprain.   I was able to get an appointment immediately upon referral and always at a the time I needed from then on.  I saw Mike and Spencer and both provided excellent care!  I always felt like I was being challenged but not overworked.  They were always quick to answer any questions I had in a way that made it easy to understand and were excellent at educating me about the exercises and how to avoid injuring my ankle in the future.

Shout out to Kivia at the front desk for being positive, upbeat and smiling at 8am every morning!

I am leaving PT stronger than I was before my injury! This is a fabulous practice and I highly recommend!"
Great experience with Spencer at PT Solutions Decatur! Thank you for helping me get stronger.
"Decent PT's for the most part, though lots of turnover as these are mostly folks doing their residency and then they move on, but the worst of is their absolutely outrageous billing practices. This place billed my insurance an average of $700 PER VISIT. Note that you are almost always sharing your therapist with 2 other patients during the same hour, so you get about 10-15 minutes of actual one-on-one attention during your appointment, if that, as the therapist is also spending part of the time updating records in the computer. And, even though I paid my copay at every single visit, my deductible has been met, and my insurance paid everything but $125 of this outrageous bill of nearly $6000 for 8 visits, they still expect me to cough up the remaining $125 balance. Completely absurd. (P.S. When you pay at the actual facility - at least at the Decatur, GA facility - it takes the desk people about 10-15 minutes to actually process your card; for some reason their payment software is some bizarre system that requires them to jump through a bunch of hoops to process a simple payment). I am switching to a private PT who charges $125/hour AND I get one-on-one sessions from him."
I have been in physical therapy before with no results. When I came to PT solutions of Decatur I was a little imperventive with the improvement that I would make. Since going I feel that I am making headway in my therapy. You guys rock
What can I say about this place!  This was my 3rd time.  I saw Mark today I would be definitely be back
Spencer and the entire team here are the absolute best!!
Everyone is nice and very professional.
i was a bit nervous about seeing a physical therapist but everyone was super welcoming and understanding. answered all of my questions and gave me hope! i highly recommend
"Philip K. has helped me changed my life with his commitment to my treatment plan.
My wife is here now seeking treatment and we couldn't be happier."
"They helped me get back where I want to be, the entire staff was nothing short of extraordinary!!! They made it easy for me to open up and express as well as work up a sweat lol but really miss each and every one of their personalities and energy. If your schedule is flip flop or if something happens, no worries because they fit you in. Exceptional place to get therapy."
"I had a fantastic experience at PT Solutions in Decatur.  I saw a number of physical therapists during the course of my treatment and all of them were knowledgeable, caring, friendly, and super-helpful.  The front desk staff were fantastic as well, always greeting you by name with a smile.  I highly recommend this facility and will go back there again if I need any physical therapy in the future."
"Truly a caring staff from the receptionists , techs and therapists. I have had a lot of physical therapists elsewhere and Matt and Crystal are a few of the best. It is not a cookie cutter facility but place where the patient is an individual and truly seen. I have hope for the first time in many years."
I had a great experience
"Nothing but praises for PT Solutions. I worked with several of the physical therapists (Rolland, Krystal, Matthew and Philip) and was impressed with all of them. They are all very professional and really listen to you. I came in for injuries relating to a car accident and saw results quickly. One thing that really impressed me was that they not only looked at my injuries but my whole body and gave me exercises to correct my whole body. After I completed my sessions they physical therapists gave me their emails and told me to email them in a couple of weeks and let them know how I was doing. I would recommend PT solutions to anyone. I was also really impressed with the front desk staff. They were always very kind and really attentive."
"I have seen Lindsay and Mathew for several treatments and the experience has been great. Each work on different aspects for my recovery and and it all works together brilliantly.

Great attention to the physical aspect of the session and nit just exercises. Although those added have been helpful. The dry needling is great and I look forward to what is next.

I had my injury 4 years ago and gave up o. PT at Benchmark. That was no help. Glad I gave it another try at PT Solutions. It is making a good difference in my life."
Everyone at PT Solutions are helpful and a joy to be around. My therapy is going great. I would highly recommend them for your therapy needs.
"I came here after being dissatisfied with another PT clinic in the area that was highly rated, and I found out quickly that PT Solutions is legitimate. They take insurance and a referral prescription is needed for care here.

I had been suffering from a bulging disc that was causing me excruciating pain 24/7. Matthew, the head therapist, really has shown concern for my wellbeing. Actually, the whole staff is caring.

Although I am not healed yet, the whole physical therapy team at PT Solutions has helped decrease my pain symptoms significantly. I look forward to what PT Solutions can do in the next month, and I‚Äôll update this review then. The facility has enough equipment needed for physical therapy.

I am a fan of PT Solutions."
PT's solution is a great place to workout they have the best equipment and the staff is courteous and professional it is a peaceful place to work out.
Went for my first appointment/eval for back pain after a referral from my doctor. The facility was nice enough and the physical therapist took the time to tell me his thoughts on the problem. At the end of the visit was surprised with a $440 bill out of pocket and informed the next 8 visits would be ~$300 each until my insurance kicked in. After reviewing my insurance claims it appears PT solutions charges $990 for your initial visit. IF YOU HAVE A HDHP STAY AWAY. This is not the place for you if you haven't met your deductible and they do not offer lower cash pay prices. Would be willing to try again once I don't have a HDHP just wish they offered more competitive pricing. Going to PT shouldn't cost me 8x more than going to the dermatologist.
Great physical therapy facility with great people. Highly recommend. The facility is very clean and the people here are very kind.
"I saw Lindsay first. The place looked like there was a shortage of equipment, but since it's been years since I've had physical therapy, so maybe that's just how most places are setup now. Also, maybe they had it in storage. I never got ultrasound and no ice afterwards. The second appointment they had another therapist, Marc, fill in for Lindsay and never notified me. So I had to go through the evaluation again."
PT Solution is the get well clinic.  Laura Beth is the bomb.  The atmosphere at the Decatur location is awesome.
They are wonderful! They address the whole body to help the problem area.
Best location for your PT experience
Great wonderful staff!










I recently completed rehab at the Calhoun location for a right total knee replacement. My goal was to ride my bicycle again after surgery. Zack Cooper helped me achieve that goal. I cannot praise him enough for his guidance and support through the process. After eight weeks they were like family.
"great place to come , very genuine and caring .took care of me the whole time while i had therapy . to the time to make sure i was doing okay everyday and made sure that my progress got better as the weeks came . highly recommend and reliable place to go to !"
Zac and the staff are very friendly and want to help you reach your goal I would go here Everytime..
"Everyone was super helpful and friendly, and were happy to explain the whys and hows of what was being done during my treatment sessions, and my carpal tunnel has improved so much I hardly feel it limit me or bother me now since my sessions."
"Great staff and they really know what they‚Äôre doing as far as meeting the needs of everyone that comes in for treatment. Would definitely recommend to friends and family, Josh and Emily are great therapists."
"I received the greatest of care at Benchmark PT in the Calhoun branch. My recovery started with a phone call and from there Emily and Rob provided professional and well executed PT. Thanks to everyone for the pleasant atmosphere, great smiles and wonderful care."
My physical therapist Zach is extremely knowledgeable and professional. I have seen a vast improvement since coming to Benchmark. The level of care I receive is far beyond any expectations I had. Physical therapy has evolved over the years and Zach and Benchmark are hitting the mark! The office is clean and the staff are very polite and helpful as well.  I highly recommend  Benchmark / Calhoun location.
"Great place to do physical therapy! It is smoothly ran by  nice people who are concerned and educated. They try to relieve your pain and discomfort to get you through your treatments. Have to say since the therapist zack has showed up the service has been a lot better and he seems to be very professional,educated and trustworthy"
Very impressed with the facility and employees. Zack did amazing work with my rehab. Immediate results. Cannot say enough good things about Zack and the Benchmark Staff.
I would first like to say some of the nicest employees by far. They care about your health and wellbeing. My issues are getting better since I've been going here. Would recommend Benchmark of Calhoun to all my friends and family.
"The staff is great. I recommend Bench Mark to all those that need PT.
We go to the one in Calhoun, Ga.
U won't b disappointed."
Loooove it

The staff at BenchMark is fantastic and so friendly. My experiences from check in and up to the end of my sessions were always pleasant. I am extremely pleased with the whole process/experience and I definitely recommend this practice to anyone in need of physical therapy.
I feel this is a great PT group. Mitchell and Thaddius was the best! They have helped me go for sore all the time on my shoulder to sleeping on it again. Laura is great too!
"Another 5-star review for the BenchMark off of Willeo Road. Very competent, professional, and personable crew. Thanks for getting this old Soldier back into the fight! Special thanks to Laura for going above and beyond by fighting through VA's bureaucratic red tape so that I could receive care."
"The whole staff at this facility make the PT experience so much fun!  They are extremely knowledgeable and go the extra mile to explain things, keeping you engaged thru the rehabilitation process.   I was most impressed with is, the one-on-one attention and care they give each patient, demonstrating that they really care about you as an individual.  I had excellent results and highly recommend Roswell Mill Benchmark PT."
"My interactions with all of the staff, Mitch, Bre, Thaddeus and Laura, was great. Everyone was very helpful and knowledgeable."
"From the time I called to now, the staff has been nothing but helpful.  Bree is very knowledgeable and has a great personality.  I love going because I leave feeling better.  The entire staff is great!"
"Bre'anna Schopke treated me for my right arm injury about two months. She is very kind and sincere. She understands  my problem and gave me an excellent service during my visiting Benchmark. Laura Littlefield is also very sincere and helpful . I highly recommend Benchmark, Roswell Mill, Roswell."
"This place is great. I was apprehensive as you never know what you are going to get when selecting from a long list.  This was the closest to me and I'm glad to have taken my 'trick' knee there. Worked mostly with Mitch, who is excellent, but the whole staff is especially caring and concerned for the welfare and success of all the Patients/Clients. Laura, Thaddius, and Bre.  Great team and good camaraderie.

Finished my treatment plan successfully, and would definitely return for another body part if necessary,  Only issue I ever had with Mitch is that he is a rabid Dawg fan."
"Staff here is unsurpassingly professional. My time as a patient at this Benchmark  location was so very rewarding to say the least. The excersizes I was taught were not only beneficial to my injury, but to my overall health as well. After visiting Brianna, I found myself being a regular guest with my gym once again. Attending physical therapy gave me just the kickstart that was needed towards pursing my own set of goals for my ideal lifestyle routine. Remember, there's a reason it's called ""therapy"". Benchmark puts you back in the game.
5- Stars"
"The staff at Roswell Mill are outstanding--courteous, helpful, and totally professional.  They've helped me with an Achilles injury that was both painful and persistent, exhibiting a dedication to helping me improve and work through my injury.  They are all about getting me back to doing the things I want to do, and always performed their work with a smile and plenty of encouragement.  Bre Schopke is an extremely skilled therapist, and has really helped alleviate pain from my injury.  I highly recommend the staff at Benchmark Physical Therapy - Roswell Mill to anyone needing physical therapy; they're simply the best!!"
"I went to the BenchMark on Willeo Rd on Monday and it was a great experience!  The staff was warm, knowledgeable, and friendly.
As a Fitness professional I like to work with people who have a heart to serve.  I'm thankful for Bre'Anna, Laura and the entire team for their helpfulness."
Ben is the best Therapist ever. He is so knowledgeable . I really appreciate their whole team. Car accidents and the injuries that follow suck. He has made the healing process easy.  #blessed
"I have had many trips to PT over the years. Some good, some bad. These past appointments with Bre and Lauren have been fantastic. The methods made sense to me and my very tricky shoulder issues are 99% resolved."
"I received physical therapy at BMT with Benjamin Barton for 3 months due to a car accident injury.  I had physical therapy before and I will say that experience was in no comparison to the work of Ben!!  My previous PT experience was not great and so I did not think this second round would be either.  I went simply because ""the doctor said so.""  Well, Ben changed my mind on the results of physical therapy.  Each session I left feeling better and I could see the results as time passed that it was working.  I owe it all to Ben and his expertise.  God forbid I need PT again (fingers crossed) but in the event I do, I will head straight back to Benjamin Barton without hesitation!!  I would go beyond 5 stars if I could.
~Jenn"
"This clinic has serviced my PT needs twice in the last 6 months.  They are so caring, positive, and never make me wait to get started.  Anytime I come in it is like a homecoming.  They are always genuinely interested in how I am feeling and the progress I am making.  Ben, the therapist continually challenges me, in a gentle way, for optimum results.

After the car accident, 6 months ago, they've treated my ankle, my shoulder and my face (TMJ).  Had shoulder surgery 9 weeks ago and the recovery is going extremely well.  I already have full range of motion...just need to strengthen the muscles.

Down the road I'll be having back surgery and know I'll be coming back for the rehabilitation.   I also frequent the Glendridge location that is close to my work and they too are super!  I highly recommend Benchmark PT."
"I was skeptical that any amount of physical therapy could alleviate the hip pain I was experiencing.  But I was wrong.  Ben, Laura and Lauren were an absolute joy to work with.  At the end of my sessions,  I was more than pleased with the progress I had made and the information I had learned.  I highly recommend them for any of your physical therapy needs."
Super caring and professional. I had surgery to fix a torn meniscus. Doing really well. Thank you!
"I'm a former hockey player (now a teacher) and consequently...I just had a bilateral total hip arthroplasty on June 13th.  I was referred by my surgeon to Benchmark and chose this location. Today I went running for the first time in probably ten years, and I am clear to skate and play again. I never imagined that this would be possible. Prior to surgery, I couldn't walk, stand, sleep...it was miserable. I came in to PT the day after surgery, and met Ben Barton...the head therapist. He was welcoming, knowledgeable, and attentive from the first moment. Van, a student intern from VA worked with me as well (under Ben's guidance) and he was equally helpful and encouraging. I am convinced that I would not have made this level of progress at this pace without Ben's help and guidance. He listened to my goals, helped me reach them, kept me in check when I needed it, and pushed me when I needed that! Additionally, Laura Littlefield handled all insurance matters (always with a smile) talking that sometimes stressful component out of the equation. I feel incredibly fortunate to have people like these helping me to achieve what I would not have thought to be possible just a short time ago. You owe it to yourself to come see Ben if you are really serious about your rehabilitation!"
"My name is Rachel Sauce, and I feel I absolutely should write about the amazing treatment I received last friday.  When leaving to come to therapy I took a very bad fall and landed on knee and leg of rt leg, because my left leg is still so weak from injury. It hurt so bad and I could not get up and had to scream for my mother to help me.  The hard wood floors in my condo made it worse. I wasn't sure if I needed to go to urgent care of E.R., but instead I went straight to Benchmark because it is only less than 5 min from my home. And I wanted them to know what was going on in case I needed to cancel my appt.  When I came in and Laura saw how red and swollen my rt knee was and that I was limping, she immediately came to my aid.  She assessed my knee and saw how bright red, swollen and hot to touch it was. She immediately got ice on it.  Her doing that so quickly contributed greatly to a reduction in swelling, redness and even pain later that evening.  She was so sincerely caring and amazing.  The therapist was also so wonderful with me, and we went ahead and did light therapy on my left leg (one I injured at work) and she took special care with my rt leg I had just fallen on, and kept ice on it and observed it.  I wish I knew her name.  She was wonderful as well.  They are such a caring team at benchmark and Laura and PT went out of their way to assure my comfort.  Please let them know how much I appreciate what they did for me, and if you can forward this review to them. I want them to know how wonderful they are.   Thank you   Rachel Sauce"
"I highly recommend Dr. Ben and his staff for PT.  They are great to work with, very friendly and caring, and they provided excellent treatment and care for a nagging and painful injury.  Great experience!"
I have received excellent treatment. The team is very professional.





Jill is an outstanding physical therapist!  She explains every movement you will make as well as the purpose for each. Jill is very patient and truly cares about your well-being.  I highly recommend Emory Rehab.
"Amazing care and attention to detail. I work in the building, so I made an appointment due to convenience, but now after my therapy and treatment, I'd drive from anywhere to come to this office. Meredith was fantastic! She explains everything and helps you along your healing journey with care and compassion. Shout out to Angela and Kari up front for the warm smiles and friendly demeanor to greet you as you walk in. I won't go anywhere else! Thanks for your help with my Planters fasciitis."
"It was easy to schedule initial appt. I like my therapist who is knowledgeable , kind and non judgmental. He encourages me but doesn‚Äôt make feel bad when I haven‚Äôt done my exercises at home. Instead he reminds me what my goal is and helps me focus on reaching it. The facility is clean and covid safety precautions practiced."
Praveen is a good diagnostic physical therapist. His range of knowledge is exceptional. I recommend him highly
Jill Smith is a 5 star therapist. Do yourself a favor and make an appointment
"Jill was very knowledgeable about my lymphadema, and gave me exercises to help me."
"Staff is polite, friendly, and professional. Nehama is far and away the most skilled and expertise physical therapist I‚Äôve ever worked with. Add to that a real concern and deep empathy for her patients, and she can‚Äôt be beat."
"What a fantastic experience it is to work with an extremely knowledgeable, versatile, and capable Physical Therapist such as Nehama Schondorf, at Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center in Sandy Springs. Nehama is a very conscientious therapist and takes the time to make sure she knows what your needs are and then goes the extra mile to make sure you understand what is needed to be done to meet those needs. Consequently, you are assured of the best chance to succeed with your rehabilitation. In addition to physical therapy, she also offers dry needling services! If it is the results you want from your PT experience, you need to go here!"
I have been struggling and in pain for years. Jill was able to rreduce my pain substantially in only 3 visits.  She is on time for my visits which helps me keep to my schedule.  The front office staff are all very friendly and helpful.  If you need physical therapy this is the place.
Jill Smith is the Best therapist! She listens to her patient and knows exactly what to do to make your body feel better so you can be on the road to recovery!!!
"Praveen was great. He was able to provide a correct diagnoses for both me and my son-in-law, where several others had failed. He also has a very pleasant demeanor and explains what is going on really well. If you need a PT, I highly recommend him."
Meredith Ireland is an excellent PT. The Center is very nice and convenient.
"Jill Smith, PT, is the greatest.    We are planning a trip to Croatia and I had almost decided to cancel our trip because of pain in my knees and back which I had attributed to my ""advanced"" age.   As a last resort, I decided to try PT.  After only 5 visits, I am almost pain free.  I have 3 more visits before we leave and I am confident that Jill Smith will have me totally healed."
Very impressive and knowledgeable therapsists. Thanks for taking good care of me.
"I Love the physical therapy with therapist Praveen Putlur, he is very knowledgeable , and throw with his explanation of your treatment.  Also, he is patient and kind.  The dry needling has been the best due to an auto accident.  It has helped me regain strength in my back that l thought was lost.  I will definitely come back for service especially with Praveen Putlur.  You won't be disappointed with your service at Emory."
"First time ever doing PT and had such a good experience here that I missed it when I left. Meredith was knowledgeable, understanding and eased my pain immensely. I really appreciate the compassion and care provided at this facility."
"I have been very impressed with the time, patience and dedication of the therapists. They work with you on your individual goals, and insure you continue to make progress each week."
This is my third rehab experience and they (and Meredith Ireland) have helped my back and neck the most
Knowledgeable and professional  physical therapist and office assistants. They made me feel comfortable at each visit. I didn‚Äôt mind asking questions and felt very pleased with the answers and information that I received.
"Meredith is fantastic! She has helped me come a long way. Although I am not finished, I feel confident she will get me back to normal. Ask for her help and she will help you achieve your goals. Thank you Meredith and everyone at Emory Rehabilitation you are helping me achieve great things in the future."
My experience with Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center has been excellent.  The therapists are experienced. The therapy they provide is knowledgeable and thorough as they aim to restore my body‚Äôs  best possible function.  Truly it will be a positive outcome to my recovery.
"I have been to three different rehab centers for therapy and this one is by far the best.  Jill Smith has been professional and knowledgeable and has helped me greatly.  It has plenty of equipment, individual attention, easy to schedule, and easily accessible. I highly recommend this facility."
"For several years Mrs. Smith and I have referred patients to one another. I am licensed massage therapist. Recently I sought her PT services for chronic right shoulder muscular tension. After only 3 sessions of dry needling, I experienced a significant release of muscular constriction and was able to move my shoulder freely without restriction. I highly recommend Mrs. Smith PT care."
Meredith has been wonderful!!  She's very knowledgeable and professional.  I have seen improvement in my shoulder function after her therapy and exercises.  I highly recommend this PT clinic!
This is my 3rd PT facility. It is heads over the other two. Jill was highly recommended by my doctor and I‚Äôm delighted he did. She is excellent. My pain has decreased significantly and I am doing better each day.
Excellent physical therapy treatment with expert advise and explanation of reason for exercise or needling when required.  Very knowledgeable staff with sincere concern for each patient's needs.  Will only use this facility for any further PT needs.
Jill give me exercises that my body needs to get stronger
"The Emory Rehabilitation  Center is the best. They take it seriously that you want to be in great shape and teach you exercises that work! My pt was Jill Smith and I also had a wonderful Emory pt student, Jessica, who helped. It was a great experience!"
"My therapist, Jill, is always tuned into my current status, listens carefully to my concerns, and adjusts my sessions appropriately, offering a variety of approaches and home exercises (I am not a PT novice, unfortunately, although it is  the first time I have used Emory Rehab).  I‚Äôm very pleased with the one-on-one time spent with the therapist, which is NOT the case with some practices."
I have really improved my condition since Meredith has been helping me. She is very professional and knowlegeable.
"I have had a hip replacement, a triple cervical spine fusion, and most recently a triple lumbar spine fusion. I have a lot of experience with physical therapy pre and post surgery. I can say without hesitation, that Emory Rehabilitation Physical Therapists are the best I have ever worked with. They are not only knowledgeable about the injury they are treating,  but how other injuries may affect what they are working with now. They treat holistically. I also appreciate how they treat me. They trust what I tell them is true. They don't suggest I'm faking my pain and they understand that PT can be taxing and exhausting. They explain WHY the at-home exercise is so important instead not caring whether you do it or not. I am actually feeling better for the first time in all my experiences with PT, and my range of motion is coming back. I owe a lot to these people and will continue to go as long as my insurance holds out."
"I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone!  My, P.T. was Jill and she is caring, very knowledgeable, and is certified in many modalities for treatments!  I have had great results!"
Jill Smith is an amazing Physical Therapist who I highly recommend! She has prescribed me exercises to help me address my issues and does an excellent job of dry needling where I have acute pain.
"Emory rehabilitation is very caring, professional, and make sure your comfortable while helping you. They work around your schedule and you are always greeted with a kind person. Thanks to Adam I have progressed faster than I thought. Thank you Emory rehabilitation."
"Meredith Ireland, PT with Emory Rehabilitation is an extremely knowledgeable & professional Physical Therapist.  Meredith took the time to fully assess my health issues and made a treatment plan to address my CRPS.   The environment at Emory Rehabilitation is pleasant with an overall sense professionalism of all therapists."
Praveen is an excellent physical therapist. He understood my situation and what he needed to do to help me. He name was given to me by my physician as being on of the best PT‚Äôs and I totally agree!
"I‚Äôm very pleased with my therapist Meredith and her knowledge and understanding of my condition. She is very professional, kind and dedicated.
Thank you Meredith"
"Emory Rehab provides excellent physical therapy services.  I was suffering from a herniated disc in my lower back which was causing severe right leg pain and drop foot.  My Physical Therapists, Praveen, worked so diligently with me and provided a whole array of services from massage to dry needling.  Praveen made sure I was in the best shape going into surgery so that I would have a better outcome.  I am two weeks post-op and am doing great because of all the expertise that was offered by Emory Rehab.  I would recommend them to anyone needing physical therapy."
"I had an outstanding PT at the Emory outpatient in Perimeter  area. She was very knowledgeable and was a good listener, who helped me get better fast!!  All the staff were friendly and caring."
"I saw two therapists over a period of several weeks. Both were knowledgeable, caring, and professional. I feel so much better, and am very grateful."
I have been a patient at Emory Rehabilitation over the past several years for several different issues.  It is a top notch facility with  wonderful therapists.  I would highly recommend them.
#The therapists are thorough and provide personal training depending on your need. Very well equipped facility to treat nearly any injury.
The best Physical Therapist team in town! When I walked in I could barely move or drive (back Injury). By the time I left I was working out again and 100% back. And in way less time than expected :-)
All of the therapists are extremely knowledgeable and most importantly have the experience needed to be able to communicate a good therapy plan in words that I understand and am able to execute.
The Therapy is working good. Mr. Praveen is very knowledgeable.
"I totally recommend Meredith Ireland DPT, OCS to anyone needing physical therapy. If you are looking for a physical therapist who will devise an effective treatment plan and provide excellent service to her patients this is the therapist for you."
Nehama makes it very easy to come to physical therapy ‚Ä¶ she listens and is very compassionate ‚Ä¶ she tries different techniques in trying to assist with the rehab ...
I found the facility to be efficient and the therapist to be very knowledgeable and caring.   I feel you can make good progress if you follow the exercises they plan for you
Terrific rehab program -- got me back in business after arm surgery.  Caring and thoughtful staff.
"PT Adam Holzwarth is now back at the Medical Centers Bldg at Emory St Joseph‚Äôs Hosp (not 1150 Hammond Drive). Adam takes the time to listen, and evaluate your pain and mobility, and come up with specific exercises just for you. And, if you like dry needling and acupuncture with tens, he can also do that. His therapies and exercises will NOT increase your pain. And I‚Äôm glad I found him through a referral from a friend at my office."
"Extremely professional. No afraid to try something new, very well pleased!!"
The Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient facility is the finest group of people that are competent and professional that both my wife have ever experienced. They are comcconcd about about your recovery and your safety during each time you are there for a treatment. We recommend this facility without any resevreserv.
"The professionalism, undivided attention, kindness,  and patience, I received
has made my experience at Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center absolutely fantastic!"
Jill Smith is amazing!
"Emory Rehab is a very professional facility with knowledgeable, caring therapists. Nehama has been my physio and she is excellent at working me through my muscular weakness and pain management to increase mobility function and range of motion."
"It's  a place where you walk in with pain and discomfort and walk out feeling better each time. From reception people are just more than nice!üòç
Professional, knowledgeable and very pleasant!"
"Excellent, thorough, thoughtful physical therapist.  Easy drive up to the door."
Meredith was my therapist and she was so helpful with her explanations and therapy.  Her dry needling was just what the knots in my upper back needed to give me long term relief.
My treatment has always been the best and my appointments are always on time.  Jill is the best!!
"The staff is totally professional, knowledgeable, and kind.  Five stars for sure!"
"Very happy with the quality of care.  Th e team is professional and qualified.
Jeff Jefferson"
I highly recommend Meredith Ireland. She and her therapies have helped ease the pain and tightness in my neck and shoulders and provided me with tools to manage them going forward.
"Praveen Pulter is professional,  very experienced  and patient PT. Highly recommended."
"Hi
Scheduling : 100% (Flexibility and Availability )
Therapist:    100% Highly Knowledgable.
I would like to thank Mr.  Praveen Putlur and his team in educating me about my body and its response  to the  therapy that helped me in subsiding the pain stiffness and its smooth functionality process  is impeccable.
Ambience: Tidy and Well placed equipments, if the facility could be expanded that will help patients to great level.
All i would say they exemplify for the conservative treatment, help patients in boosting their low confidence and get back the lost smile.
Personal Care: I see a different experience from rest of the locations , here personal care is being taken to make sure i do my therapy exercise as it is designed to get cure.

I have referred a co-worker who was mis diagnosed for this pain in neck and headache as sinus, fortunately their patience in understanding the issue  and treatment helped him subside the pain and get back his social activity."
"Nehama Schondorf, DPT is an amazing PT. She has amazing healing hands and healing heart. The energy that she exudes is instrumental in her healing. I was referred by my Ortho for PT and was selected by Dr. Schondorf randomly. She thoroughly assessed my chronic back pain and discussed my options for reducing my pain. When she recommended dry needling, i was open, because i had been in so much pain for so long. She explained step by step and within 10 minutes she had relieved my pain and increased my flexibility. I walked out of the office feeling amazing."
Very convenient location.  Great staff.
Meredith does a great job working with you to develop a course of physical therapy that addresses the problem and reduces pain/discomfort.
Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center gets results. Excellent PT facility
"outstanding organization with highly qualified, dedicated personnel!!"
Great facility! Great PTs!
Excellent service by the physical therapist...

























"The staff here is great, they can help with your rehabilitation and pain"
Very knowledgeable and friendly staff. Very effective round of PT for me. They‚Äôre personable and make you feel comfortable and welcome each visit. I highly recommend the Wilmington Island location of BenchMark!
I was prescribed a physical therapy regimen of lumbar Mackenzie exercise  from an orthopedic surgeon. Mark at Benchmark executed a plan to eliminate the suspected culprit ;  piriformus syndrome where the piriformis muscle irritates the sciatic nerve and causes pain in the butt radiating down the leg. I couldn't sleep or sit for more than 2 hours. I attended the clinic for 10 sessions and continued the exercises via the MedBridge GO app he provided me. I wasn't diligent with the app but after not getting relief after the 3rd week of therapy I worked hard on continuing the regimen at home. I was so discouraged because the symptoms didn't subside after all this work. One week after completing my sessions and continuing the home exercise I'm ecstatic to say the pain disappeared. I'm grateful to Mark for his expertise in the therapy plan and instruction and highly recommend he and his team.
Over the years I have had lots of therapy in different states and different companies but Benchmark has given me the best result do to the individual attention to small detail that make the progress faster and I have been there for 3 problems.
We love the people at BenchMark on Wilmington.  They are kind and knowledgeable and are doing a great job working with my young son.
I can‚Äôt say enough about Erick Heckaman and PT of Marietta. The therapist and the therapy have helped almost immediately and still working on a few areas. The staff is friendly and helpful which is great when you are in pain!  I would recommend PT of Marietta and Erick to everyone.
"This was my goto PT place.  I have used them for my own needs as well as those of my children.  I will not be using them any more.  Now that they are fully affiliated with Wellstar they are now overpriced.  As an example PT solutions fee for on hour charged to insurance was $75.  Which means they are charging over $375 for that service.  Before Wellstar got involved the most I paid was $25 at the same location.  I contacted 4 other in network PT companies close by and the average charge is $25 an hour.  Same credentials, same therapy more than 10x cost.  Check price before your visit.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this business to a friend.  Shame on Wellstar for destroying a great local service"
"Awesome team of therapists. Friendly, caring & knowledgeable."
Everyone is so nice and so efficient! Already feeling better! Love this place!
Great experience during the short time I was there.  Kristen was really good to work with.  Everyone very nice.
"Outstanding, great job with Sarah, she is definitely helping me, she is incredibly knowledgeable, the staff is nice, everyone is friendly and welcoming, the facility is super clean and safe re: covid.  I highly recommend Sarah and PT Solutions of Marietta!"
Great assessment and attention to detail in creating my plan to get better!
"Best PT I‚Äôve experienced. No shortcuts with heating pads- they hand massage your muscles. Multifaceted exercises using all types of equipment. The whole hour is utilized effectively, not wasted on ice packs which I can do at home, altho it is offered when the hour is up. Education given is excellent. Once home you receive email explaining your symptoms, videos of exercises. Excellent all around!"
This is my first time doing any kind of organized therapy for my injuries and I am very pleased with PT Solutions in Marietta. The entire team is great and keep a fun but professional environment. Dino really knows his stuff and after just a few sessions already has me on the mend. I look forward to continuing my therapy sessions.
"Wonderful group, u will feel like u all one family plus u will get better,"
"I‚Äôve been 5 times so far and very pleased with Chase, my therapist.  He is very goal oriented and takes time to explain exercises."
"The staff is professional, well versed in their skills and work together as a team. Check in was a breeze, they are flexible with scheduling and explained the routines/exercises to me and monitored as most of the excercises are not something I would do in a normal day."
"The staff at PT Solutions is wonderful.  They are a very caring and dedicated crew.  The personal attention is outstanding.  Dino went above and beyond just being my physical therapist, he truly cared about my overall well-being."
My therapist understood my injury and the treatment protocol to expedite my recovery ü§ó
"Great place to rehab. Professional staff who listen and assist you to feel and get better. Office staff go out of their way to guide you thru insurance.
Again, wonderful and helpful people here."
Erin B is a wonderful person and amazing at her job. I have come so far because of her with my ankle. Highly recommended her. The entire staff is so fun and makes it a fun experience. I miss the days I‚Äôm not at PT and look forward to the days I do go.
"I got to know about PT Solutions when my wife was prescribed physical therapy by her doctor and was impressed with the treatment she received. As a result when I was prescribed physical therapy, naturally I decided to go with PT Solutions because I knew how well their patients were treated. I would recommend PT Solutions to anyone that needs physical therapy."
"PT solutions are extremely experienced, friendly and show great consideration and kindness to their patients. They are encouraging and know your capabilities and limits. I would definitely recommend PT Solutions to anyone who needed Physical Therapy."
Very knowledgeable and friendly group of therapists! Highly recommend doing your physical therapy here.
I had sustained 3 fractures in my left foot over a year ago but was not referred for PT at that time....after much a-do and continued concerns that I was not recovering completely I revisited my Ortho doc and he referred me to PT Solutions.  WOW....what a difference....the discomfort began to diminish after my first visit with Sarah!  It's amazing how much better I am in such a short amount of time.  Highly recommend and appreciate what you do:-)
Friendly staff and excellent care. We never have to wait. I highly recommend!
Professional in all areas of my therapy. My therapist is aware of my problems and treats them with great care and professionalism. I look forward to each session.
"I have used PT Solutions on several different occasions. I find them always to be professional, thorough, yet personal and caring about my well-being. I have been completely satisfied with the results of my treatments."
"Excellent facility. Dino and all staff are an outstanding group of professionals, who have created a caring and friendly environment for their patients."
"Great staff, just be prepared WellStar charges 3x what other local PT agencies charge.  Ask what you will be charged before you go and shop around."
"The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and, they get results. Highly recommend them."
"I had peroneal tendonitis for months. With just a few visits with Emily, I'm back to running and feeling great. The entire staff is courteous and very knowledgeable."
Excellent care. Friendly staff.
"Despite their unfortunate affiliation with WellStar Health Systems, PT Solutions remains one of the most remarkably efficient group of talented, caring and intelligent clinicians in the Marietta/Kennesaw region."
Very friendly and highly competent team. It was my pleasure to meet them.
Friendly staff! Everyone is helpful and encouraging.
Great group of people!  Great organization!
Dallas and the entire staff at PT Solutions are wonderful caring people!!
They're good.
Great caring therapists!

"Excellent physical therapy from Jynelle Jarvis and the entire staff.

5 Stars all the way!!

Thanks for a great job

Best physical therapy I‚Äôve had. My therapist is Noah Reyhl and he has shown me how to make my back better with custom exercises that actually work. He listens and understands my pain then does something to make it better. It‚Äôs amazing what he knows. I call him the ‚Äúback whisper‚Äù
Great team of Therapists.  I had a wonderful rehabilitation experience with the team after my shoulder surgery.
My therapist Noah Reyhl created a routine that worked for me and my body while still continuing to help me progress throughout treatment.
"Roland Webster, the physical therapist, at PT Solutions in Snellville is a great combination of professional knowledge and skill.  He explained my physical problems to me in many ways and helped ease my pain as the symptoms kept changing.  I have had to go to PT several times in my life and he is the best therapist I have seen.  I highly recommend him."
"The staff at this facility are WONDERFUL! This was my first experience with physical therapy, and I must say, Rowland and Meina exceeded my expectations. I had rotator cuff surgery, and had no mobility afterwards. They are very knowledgeable, courteous, attentive, and friendly. They also take measures to keep things clean, which is very important to me. It has been less than 3 months since my surgery, and I can do just about anything I was able to do prior to surgery. I would highly recommend PT Solutions of Snellville for your physical therapy needs, they will take great care of you."
"This has been the first time I need physical therapy.  I did some research prior to making a decision on the PT provider.  The entire staff at the Snellville location are amazing.  They are very welcoming, friendly and attentive.  From the initial appointment, the therapists were able to set a course of action with my specific issue.  I loved the diversity of the exercises with each appointment.  I wasn't optimistic that PT would help my pain and overall mobility prior to taking it.  However, within the few months of the appointments and at-home exercises, I am able to live an active life with little to no pain, something that I haven't been able to do in two years.  It was the best experience I could have hoped for and firmly believe a big part of that was the care taken by the Snellville staff."
I was fortunate enough to find PT Solutions in Snellville when in need of PT for some neck issues. They were everything I could have hoped for to resolve my issues. The therapists are very knowledgeable and professional and along with the front desk staff followed all COVID safety protocol. I could not have been happier with my experience and outcome. I highly recommend them.
"The Whole Staff At The Snellville Location Knows Exactly What They Are Doing And They Are Saying. They Treatments Are Custom Made For Whatever You Are Dealing With. If You Don‚Äôt Feel Like The Treatment Is Helping, They Are Willing To Cooperate With You To Finding Something That Will Help Whatever YouAre Dealing With."
"Roland and Ashley (sp?), are wonderful!  Great location, easy to get an appt, professional, and they really listen and pay attention to what is going on with your body.   I would highly recommend them!"
"I am glad that I find this PT Soultions for my physical therapy. I have been suffering with the tendon on my left foot for more than three years. I have been to four different doctors and PT is my second physical therapy, I can't tell you how happy I am finding this place. From walking to the building, to the front desk and the therapist Roland Webster. Roland is a great guy. He understood my problem and took action to take care this problem not only to my foot, but worked from my back to the foot. I have seen him only for one week and I can't tell how better I feel. I can't wait to do the activity that I always like is running. Also, I am taking my youngest son who is active cross country and track runner to PT because he has issues with his hip.

Thank you all off you at PT Soultions
Samuel Gebreyesus"
Great.Efficient and professional. .
"The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. Noah and Israel have helped me tremendously , and they are very personable. I would highly recommend this location for anyone seeking physical therapy. You'll recieve first class service with a great hospitality and insight!"
"I was referred to PT solutions by my PCP after being in a car accident.
I am so happy I chose the snellville location. The staff is so friendly and caring.
Best front desk service & Noah is awesome!"
"What can I say!!! Israel was awesome! He really worked with my shoulder and signed me upon Strivehub. It helped me do the stretches at home. He address every concern I had and sent me flowers when I had a death in family. Noah was fantastic! With his help and isometric work, I have more range of motion in my arm, shoulder, and neck. I almost feel like I am back to normal. Thank you so much PT Solutions!!!! Check them out if you are near the area!!!"
I‚Äôm only giving this company a 5 star ‚≠êÔ∏è rating because of Nicole! She is very helpful and  prompt. I was having issues with billing and let‚Äôs just say if Nicole did not put in the extra work I would still be waiting on the billing Dept.
"Martha and Nicole rock! I have MS and have had to go to physical therapy several times over the last 18 years due to MS related falls. I have NEVER been to a therapist that not only treated me for my injury, but was also familiar with MS and knew that I needed therapy to improve my strength and balance to help prevent future falls (something my neurologist said I would be hardpressed to find). Martha is an answer to a prayer! Both of these ladies really care about the patients that they help. I can't say enough good things about them. I'd give them 10 stars if I could!!"
Best best physical therapy I've ever had! Martha and Nicole are amazing.
Very concerned and effective treatments.
Therapist is highly knowledgeable and pays attention to every detail. She‚Äôll make you whole again!
Nicole brown is the best ever!üòç
NICOLE GET THINGS DONE AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH HER
Nicole & Martha make a great team!!





I started with Monica 2 weeks ago and she is wonderful. She  has helped loosen my shoulder and give me the right amount of exercises to not overdo my shoulder injury. She is a joy to be around and puts you at ease. She always makes me smile and laugh amongst the pain of stretching my shoulder. I would highly recommend using Monica at the Coal Mountain location.
"My experience was great! The past 5 months were rough physically but I am now headed in the right direction all thanks to Mr. Hans Rice. He made sure I was prepared to get back to what I am used to. I‚Äôm very thankful for his help, the laughs and for also making me feel welcomed and comfortable . I‚Äôll be back to visit every now and then. Keep up the good work!"
"I‚Äôve went to a few of the physical therapist and they are all phenomenal. Everyone from Danielle, to Kirsten, to Hanz really knew their stuff. They were all very accurate with me about my arm and how it was healing during each  phase of my recovery process. Overall, I am beyond satisfied with how my arm feels now after my physical therapy sessions at Benchmark. I would definitely recommend them!"
I had to go to this location for five full months.  My therapist was Kristen Humphries. She's the BEST.  She is very knowledgeable and professional. She has taken care of my problem very well and I am so satisfied.  The staff is very nice. I like to recommend this location to anybody.  This is a great facility.
"Dr. Hans Rice and Tech Stephen Jones are the best!! You can sense their caring hearts. Now, equipped with easy to understand home exercises, I am closer to 100% healing. Highly recommend!!"
Excellent facility! Received outstanding treatment from Blake and Jana after my auto accident. Their expertise and patience will have you on the road to recovery! And Josh is a wonderful coach. Highly recommended!
"I rate this location an A+. The entire staff are very professional and practical. Their personality, attitude and respect towards me and others were a major part in my recovery. Everything they do and say is uplifting.
I thanked them personally. If I ever need physical therapy again, Benchmark , E West Connector will be my 1st choice!!"
"Friendly staff and you become like family. Love them all!!! The first initial consultation is a complete evaluation to help identify your weakness and strengths. This evaluation is not only through a few designated test, but the expertise, experience and the knowledge of your physical therapist.

I have been out of work since April-2019 and was in the hospital for a month. After that released to a nursing home rehab facility for physical therapy for another month. Finally I returned home in June with an assisted walker, as well as a folding commode for assistance of getting off the toilet.

My first appointment was in July. When I arrived I had extreme difficulty walking up stairs, problems with my gait, an inability to get in and out of  the car, as well as getting in and out of the bed. My upper body strength was so weak it was difficult to turn over in the bed.

Thanks to BenchMark, I'll return to work on September 3rd. Finally my normalcy has arrived! BenchMark you rock! Thanks Chris!! (Ms Marks)"
"My experience at BenchMark Physical Therapy was very ""therapeutic."" Physical Therapist Jana was very knowledgeable, gentle and very kind.  I highly recommend BenchMark Physical Therapy!"
"The people here are awesome! They greet you by name, and strive to get you back in shape.  Love Jana, and Russell. They are like family."
"Anna the hand therapist is the best and most compassionate therapist I have ever had. She take the time to get to know you and your therapeutic needs. I recommend her highly for anyone with hand issues.
Lydia Weathers"
"Dr. Kristen Humphries is the BEST physical therapist I've ever seen. The attention and compassion she shows her patients complement her extensive knowledge and training. If I have pain or discomfort from my exercises, she knows how to immediately alleviate it. Dr. Humphries is a gift to the field of Physical Therapy.

Also, Rosalyn and Stephen at the front desk are kind and efficient. I look forward to their smiles every visit."
"Great place if injured! I was in a car accident and have some serious neck pain. Great staff, kind and caring. They make you work though....be prepared to sweat but its all for benefit. Been here about 3 months about to finish up soon. Happy to have been referred here by my MD."
The staff is Awesome Jana and Chip excellent A+ keep up the good work.
The staff is very kind and worked with me very well

Exelente servicio me sent√≠a como en casa"




My son had an ankle issue that we began PT on at ATI in Austin TX. When he returned to college he found the ATI location close to him. What a disappointment- he had a different therapist every session and none of them reviewed any notes from prior visits. This resulted in them not being able to build on previous exercises or progress. He would be doubled up with a therapist and split time with another patient and told to just do his exercises on his own. In a month he made absolutely no progress. He has cancelled all future appointments and is looking for a new therapist elsewhere
Personable. Professional. Patient. I cannot speak highly enough about the staff.
I am going through dry needling to help recover from a stroke.   The results have exceeded my expectations.   Emily is well trained in her profession and is very efficient.   Great experience through the first three sessions.
"Nina, Emily and Carley have been great to work with!! Would definitely recommend!!"
Great therapists and I am happy with my progress!
"Hello,
I am glad to give my thoughts about the wonderful services that ATI provides to those who are truly  in need.
I myself need strengthening, stretching and exercise to improve my mobility.  The kind, courtious ,gentle, caring staff are professional and know their jobs well.
Let me tell you it is no fun to fall and not able to get back up, very frustrating to say the least.
I myself have suffered such a fate.
Injury and the enability to get up from the hard floor; due to loss of strength.
ATI helps so many people get back to a normal lifestyle; what was life like before ATI?.
I thank God for the dedicated, caring staff of ATI and all that they do every single day.

Sincerely,  John Steenhagen - current patent."
"My husband had issues with vertigo that were not responsive to  manipulation by his physician, so we were referred to ATI in Clemson for evaluation and treatment.  He spent 2 days a week for a total of 4 weeks mostly with NIna Chitty.  He was not the most cooperative patient to work with but she was extremely patient with him and was able to work well with him.  He developed  a lot of trust in her and at the end of the 4 weeks he was symptom free.  We are both grateful for their hard work and knowledge as Nina explained every intervention with him and how it would benefit him.  Great job!!"
It was a pleasure to work with all y'all I needed it may see y'all soon
"Nina was very professional, knowledgeable, and an outright miracle worker!"
"I went to Nina for help with vertigo that had been plaguing me for 10 days.  She diagnosed the problem and was able to fix it within an hour's appointment!  She is knowledgeable and professional, but above all, she truly cares about her clients.  I will be recommending her to all of my friends who have vertigo."
The staff at the Clemson facility is great.  Not only are they friendly and make you feel comfortable they also know what they are doing.
"This is the place to be for therapy related to spinal injury, stroke, nerve related diseases, etc. if you live anywhere near Clemson, SC.  The team of therapist here all focus on these types of issues.  I have been treated here for six months after a spine surgery that didn't go well, and they have worked together to help, challenge, and motivate me to make progress, and indeed I have made remarkable progress."
Emily was my physical therapist and she did an excellent job!   She really knew how to help me and she understood what needed to be done. I also saw Leeann and she was also excellent!
Very good people and work hard to help you recover
"Staff is super friendly and make you feel you are right at home. I was afraid it would be awkward, but it was fun and entertaining! I appreciate the kindness of everyone there!"
"I just graduated from my physical therapy sessions at ATI on Clemson Blvd., and I am pleased to write that the therapy worked, I am pain free. Each of the therapist that worked with me were very knowledgeable and professional. They focused on and gave me undivided attention every session. All during this experience, I felt that they sincerely tried to pin point the root cause of my hip pain and to prescribe the best therapeutic exercises and maneuvers for the diagnosis. They truly worked with me to make each session effective and to form a partnership to ensure positive results. I had a wonderful experience under the care of the ATI Physical Therapy Tiger Blvd Team, and I highly recommend their services."
"ATI CLEMSON by far exceeds all of my wishes. From the moment I first walked in the door I could feel the
Hope that I was going to improve greatly and
Wow did I ever!!! The people that work their are some of the greatest
Blessings in my life. They know their stuff, they push you to succeed and they show this in all their words, and actions. They truly Care!!
Wonderful job  Nina, Emily,  Leanna, Erin, JT and Luke!! You guys ROCK!!!"
"I have had a very wonderful experience at ATI Physical Therapy at Clemson West. Nina gave me a very thorough evaluation. Nina, Erin, Emily,  Leanna, and J.T.  - all the  Therapists were very knowledgeable, compassionate,  and even FUN!!! The receptionist was also very compassionate when she saw my bruise. My balance has improved tremendously and I would definitely recommend ATI Clemson West to everyone!!!"
Taking my wife to ATI Clemson after having meningitis and 8 Brain surgeries. Could not ask for any better therapy and after just 3 weeks I can tell the difference. Everyone at ATI Clemson are so nice and explain everything they are doing and why. By the way Emily is a sweetheart! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Such sweet and caring therapists!!
"Caring, helpful therapists that offer neuromuscular therapy. This specialty assists with dizziness and balance issues. They have been able to teach me strategies for dealing with the problem."
Best therapy. Best therapists. Best results. Best follow up. Highly reccomend!!
Dedicated staff helps push my limits
This location has the most genuine caring staff I have ever been to. Special shout out to Emily and Nina.
Great clinic with the most friendly and professional staff.
They were very friendly and professional.  Listen to what I had to say and provided extreme support and care.
They have been working with my son and they have talked to me and I think they're really helping him








"Both my daughter and I had to come here for treatment. The staff was welcoming, professional, and kind. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect at first but they exceeded my expectations. Dr. Michelle and her staff were wonderful and we received amazing care for our injuries after our car wreak. I would recommend them over and over."
I had total knee replacement on June 17. I went to Benchmark PT at Boulevard location and cannot recommend Michele and the team highly enough. They made going to Therapy a fun experience while making sure I worked hard and achieved my goals. Have the second knee done soon and I won‚Äôt go anywhere else but back to Michele and team.
"On 5-7-20 I was involved in a 3 car pile up.  Some time after I started my PT at Bench Mark . The Physical Therapist , Lina D. was INCREDIBLE , she  instructed me on the How To's , Do's & Don't and because of her Guidance . My lower back feels Great . Lina is an Asset to your Company and has Wonderful Personality for dealing with People , Her Customer Service Skill Set is of True Concern and Compassion for her Patients. Thank you Bench Mark for Providing an Excellent Service, Excellent Atmosphere and Excellent Therapist ."
"Very friendly and professional folks, extremely knowledgeable, all-around good experience. I'll be back!"
I absolutely love this place and the whole staff there is awesome! I was a little a skeptic starting out but after going visit after visit it got better and better and my leg feels back to normal. Thank You for everything!
"I didn't know what to expect when I started physical therapy with BenchMark because of a sprained MCL. In less than two months, I progressed from limping and having problem getting into my car to walking almost back to normal. I also have learned a lot of things that I could do to improve my knees' health! I really appreciate my therapist's skills that has helped me heal almost effortlessly."
Great Service!! Great people!! I Highly recommend!!
"Great staff. Great environment.
Gonna miss the 7am Crew! üíö"
"This small business provides excellent Physical Therapy. I have been to a few larger companies, only interested in taking your money. The Therapists are caring and concerned with your progress. They have the ability to multitask, assisting more than one person when needed, yet make you feel as if you are the only client. Should you need Therapy, tell them Michael says they are the best!!"
"Stephanie and Rebecca are the two therapists who are helping me gain mobility  in a way that does not cause me so much pain. Level of care is excellent. From the wonderful ladies at the desk to the therapists, this center is wonderful!"
Staff is very friendly and helpful. They provide personal attention and make each visit enjoyable. Great parking options and easy access to building.
"The staff here is great, I have had the opportunity to be assisted by all three therapist during my treatment period and they are all professional. i highly recommend them."
"I have to tell you that I am very pleased with the level of care I receive at Benchmark aquatic. I cannot thank my PT Rebecca Sherman enough for her skills and caring personality. She is knowledgeable, listens to my concern,encourage me and adjust my treatment according...ok she doesn't play around when it comes to stretching and getting that work in ..üòÇbut that's what you need..Thanks again Rebecca ."
"Awesome therapists! Claire, Stephanie, Mark, and Singing Corey are phenomenal!"
Nice place !!

I had knee replacement surgery and benchmark and Matt did my physical therapy. I am very pleased with my therapy and the treatment i received. I couldn't have ask for any better than the excellent care i got. Thank you Matt and Benchmark in Monroe!!!
Excellent and professional care from a very expert staff.  Check in is always a pleasure.  Would highly recommend.
"I was referred to BenchMark for Aquatic Therapy for lower back pain - Paige Gillis was my therapist. She is so knowledgeable about every part of the human body it's incredible! We did several weeks of aqua therapy and I learned an entire routine for core strengthening to add to my regular swimming. We then did some ""land"" therapy and again, I learned new stretches and exercises for core strengthening and even had dry needle therapy, which Paige is incredible at. The entire staff here is fantastic, the facility is immaculate and they very quietly make sure that everyone feels safe and relaxed. It's an upbeat, friendly, happy place! I recommend this entire group for whatever therapy you need!"
Kim is very good at what she does. They are all very nice . I would recommend going to them .
Great people there
"This is my second time using this facility for therapy and each time has been a positive experience. Mr.Peddle(Art) is an experience in itself üòÄ Art is very professional and well advanced in his knowledge of his craft. I have watched him with his patients as well as my own personal encounter and I must say,"" I'm the better"" for having him as my therapist. The receptionist Valerie is just as warm and friendly as Art and the rest of the staff. Art has a sense of humor that immediately attach itself to you like extra calories from a slice of cake but you don't care it's just that good(funny) If or whenever you need a Therapist, give this place a call. I promise you a two for one, Physical Therapy and A Comedian; both are great for overall health.
Thank you Guys
Teresa"

"Been going here for a while the staff is great always nice and works you hard, have made so much progress since being here definitely a great place to go for therapy."
"The staff is really nice, welcoming. Especially  Jessica. She was very explaintory and patient with me."
"Dianna is adorable she has such a sweet phone voice and is very kind and professional.
I worked with Doug and Hayley.  They are great and kind.  They both explain things and use models and photos to explain howyour body isn't working like it should be and how to fix what is wrong  They are gentle and kind and funny we were laughing and having a great time.  I love them and recommend to them to anyone who has a need for PT"
"The dedication and support from the physical therapists for the patients at this clinic is inspiring. Everyone working (front desk, assistants, techs, and therapists) truly cares for every person that walks through the door. They listen to their patients needs and addresses them head on with the utmost care and efficiency. They're extremely personable and so easy to talk to. Thumbs up for PT Solutions, Dalton."
Excellent service and people! Especially Raul! He is very professional and loves his job! He always had a smile on his face and was always so welcoming!
Melissa is SO perfect with my daughter for speech therapy. I literally drive 40 minutes just for my daughter to see her! I‚Äôve seen improvements since the very first visit and I couldn‚Äôt be happier!
All the therapists are excellent. They genuinely care for you and your recovery.
I went in with left arm and shoulder pain i could not even get my dishes out of the cabinets they helped me to  get back to doing all the things I wanted to do.  I recommend them 1000 percent to anyone  who needs help with pain and stiffness. They really care about their patients.
My daughter goes here for speech and feeding therapy. Awesome and very professional staff!
Love this place & Staff
Ya'll are awesome!!!

Muy profesionales,excelente atencion."

"Outstanding service! Extremely professional and courteous.  They always remember what you would like to be called by. I went in barely walking with the assistance of a walker and by the end of all my sessions,  I was able to jog without any pain or discomfort. Thanks Benchmark at Hickory Flat."
"This was the most positive therapeutic environment. Everyone worked so well together and were all very professional and concerned for your well being. I was personally recovering from rotator cuff surgery and an environment like this is important. My main therapist Daniel has exceptional skills, concern and bedside manner.
Will highly recommend this place."
I had shoulder surgery in April and started therapy with the team at Benchmark on Hickory Flat Hwy in late April. I was impressed with their care  from Day 1. Dr. Klay Fann and his team guided me through each step of recovery. I regained almost full range of motion in only 3 months. I‚Äôm so happy to be back to doing the things I love without pain. Highly recommend this team to help you recover.
"I highly recommend this BenchMark location!! Everyone that works here is wonderful. They are welcoming, accommodating, and professional.  I just finished 6 months of physical therapy with Daniel and can't recommend him and the rest of BenchMark enough. They made sure I was challenged yet successful in my physical therapy so that I made progress each visit. You won't be disappointed!"
"To give an indication of how great this Benchmark location is, I drive 35-40 minutes to go. I did ballet much of my life and now teach/do yoga and barre as well as running. I have had 3 hip arthroscopies (1 on the R and 2 on L because it needed a revision surgery). Prior to that I went to try to avoid surgery (which was not an option really, but I went to Daniel for dry needling, etc). While I see Daniel and have for years, I cannot say enough good things about all the therapists. All of them. Excellent! And the staff. While the most important thing is obviously results and you will without a doubt be pleased with the results, you‚Äôll also find the experience to be easy and efficient and a family like feel, which is nice to have as well. They really are fantastic in all capacities. Highly recommended. I‚Äôd not go anywhere else."
Great place with great people! Everyone is friendly and has your best interest in mind. All the therapists are great and have really helped me with my pain!
"Daniel and all his staff are knowledgeable, compassionate and truly care about helping their patients get the best possible outcome."
"What can I say? I am a very satisfied  repeat customer who occasionally needs help with Physical Therapy. Holly Springs has excellent therapists, the staff is super accommodating, and it  offers a  relaxed environment.
They strictly  follow CDC guidelines for infection control and that is a big plus. Kudos to Klay and the rest of the staff."
"After my shoulder rotator cuff repair surgery I chose Benchmark Physical Therapy in Hickory Flat.  As a PT myself, I was very impressed with their friendliness and individualized attention.  My treatment sessions were tailored to my concerns and how I was feeling each time.  My last session was bittersweet as I am going to miss seeing them all each week.  I would highly recommend this location."
What can I say?  If you need PT this is THE place to go.  The staff is outstanding and my therapist Dan could not have been more caring.  Always aware of your pain levels and to make sure you don‚Äôt do things that put you in any pain. Always attentive.  A pleasure.  Thanks guys.
"Love this place! I felt welcomed here from the very beginning. Every staff member knew my name by the second visit and would engage in thoughtful conversations. The therapists are very knowledgeable and offer a variety of skills and expertises. I received exercises to do at home to keep my progress moving, and felt comfortable asking questions if I didn‚Äôt understand something. Excellent facility and even better people!"
"When in pain, the team at Hickory Flat BenchMark are game-changing! Truly, every person there is so positive, kind, and works with you to understand what is needed to improve. Daniel, Nick, and Klay have been so helpful in providing new techniques to help me be a better functioning person, physically! Thank you!!!"
"I blew out my shoulder in a mountain bike accident (two tears in my rotator cuff and a torn bicep tendon) and, after surgery, went to Benchmark in Hickory Flat for PT.  They were incredibly professional, attentive, and effective to the point where my recovery was speedier than expected.  In fact, my Orthopedist told me that my progress, after three months, was remarkable to the point where I no longer needed PT.  Sorry my friends at Benchmark, you did such a good job that my time with you was shorter than expected!  Thank you for your excellent care!"
"The entire staff at Benchmark Holly Springs were so helpful and encouraging to me during my recovery.  I was in a bad auto accident and suffered from a tibial plateau fracture as well as a spiral fracture of the humerus.  Bot requires surgery and metal plates with screws.  I also had 9 broken ribs as well as a boxer fracture in the left hand.  Bring in the hospital for a month and in a wheel chair left me very gloomy about my prospects not knowing what the future held for me.

Klay Fann and his experience helped me to recover and improve my mobility and strength and gather confidence that I could do some of the things that I loved doing prior to the accident.  It required a lot of hard work that paid off.  Both Klay and Asher worked with me closely and helped me and encouraged me to press on.  It was not easy but I am glad to report I am functional after 4plus months of therapy.  I recently participated and ran most of the way in a trail race only a week and 6 months after the accident.

I thank everyone there including Daniel and Renee and Hayley also for their positive attitudes.  If you are serious about getting well and want to put in the time, with this great team at Holly Springs you can do it!!!

Dale Burke"
Amazing therapists! Amazing results! Daniel is very knowledgeable and extremely caring. He helped improve several issues I was dealing with and left me much healthier. Entire staff is great! You won‚Äôt be disappointed!
Benchmark is awesome! They really care and work hard at getting you to work hard to heal.
I had been suffering from knee pain for a couple of months. They were able to help me in a matter of weeks. Definitely will be recommending them to relatives and friends!
"EXCELLENT place. AMAZING staff. All very kind, polite, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, very interested in overall well-being and outcome from therapy.

Are amazing.
Polite welcoming, helpful on the floor, overall a FANTASTIC place!
I‚Äôve had therapy at 5 Seperate locations, (once for 2 yrs at NSF Hospital, it was an excellent facility and team, but much LARGER & Farther. But, you get the same great care and wonderful
People from THIS Benchmark location.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!
Thanks to all,
Steve Miles"
"FIVE STARS!!!  Yes that's correct.  They are the best. If you are reading reviews to find a PT location, this is the place. Fast results in a warm and friendly environment. Thanks to Klay and all the staff !"
"Best therapist ever!  Daniel,  Clay and Sam are awesome and the staff is super!   I worked with them following shoulder surgery and couldn't have asked for better treatment.  Even if you have to drive a little ways to get to them, they are so worth it.  Highly recommended!!!!"
Great staff!  You can't go wrong going to this location if you need physical therapy.
Made me a believer in physical therapy. Great staff! Thanks for all you do!
"Aside from helping me tremendously with my pain, everyone in the office is warm and friendly. I appreciated that there was no long wait times when you come in and between the exercises and therapy. Daniel has his fingers on the pulse of everything going on in there and makes sure everyone is being attended to and feels okay. I hope I won't need to go back, however, definitely will if the need arises! Thanks Daniel!"
"Great service and great staff.  I am a Chiropractor, and can vouch for how they work."
"Physical therapy at BenchMark was such a great experience. I felt very well taken care of by all of the staff. I was always welcomed by a warm smile and the clinic had a great welcoming and working atmosphere! Each visit, I felt great leaving and was well informed about what to work on and how to better my exercises to improve. Any questions I had, I felt comfortable reaching out and was always answered with a quick response. I would highly recommend this clinic!"
Friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Klay helped me get over a shoulder injury with patience and skill.
This office is very friendly and welcoming. All the staff are so kind and genuinely care about their patients! Daniel is my therapist and I am so appreciative of him. He‚Äôs very thorough and sincerely cares to get the best outcome possible.
"I can‚Äôt say enough great things about the staff, Klay, Hailey, Renee and Emily. I started  going there two months ago to rehab a surgically repaired broken ankle.

At the time, I couldn‚Äôt walk forward and needed to side-shuffle to get around. The team took the time to understand what my limits, area of opportunity and personal goals are and designed a plan just for me.

Within a week I began walking normally (2 sessions). Soon after I was doing agility drills because not only was my ankle rehabilitated, but the rest of my leg muscles were strengthened to support more rigorous activity than before my injury.

I‚Äôm very grateful for all the effort and personal care that I received."
"The staff at this Benchmark is WONDERFUL! When I had my injury I couldn‚Äôt simply walk let alone jump, swim, run etc.. Daniel was determined to get me back to normal daily activities. He was very personable and knowledgeable. I have been in physical therapy for multiple injuries and this was the worst one I had. He is by far my favorite therapist. He is the best of the best and I would recommend him to anyone. I am forever thankful for him and the staff that has helped me along my recovery."
"I've been a patient of Dr. Dan's for years and won't go anywhere else! He is extremely professional, kind, thorough, does great followup and truly cares about his patients.

The office is fun, friendly and very responsive. I would highly recommend this group to anyone!"
I had a great experience at Benchmark! The entire staff is very friendly and welcoming and they cultivate a great atmosphere. Both Daniel and Klay are very knowledgeable and do a great job of treating any injuries. I would highly recommend BenchMark Physical Therapy for anyone in need of physical therapy!
"Klay was an amazing PT. I went in with crutches due to both knees being injured, and 2 weeks later I was off them. And now I‚Äôm walking perfectly normal and still do the home exercises he gave me to be sure it stays that way. Everyone in the office is super friendly and helpful. All the techs that help the PT‚Äôs are great at there job as well- Haley, Asher, Allison, Josie, and Emily. And the office coordinator, Arionne,  is super nice and a great person to see when you first enter the office!"
Benchmark Physical Therapy is the best!  I felt so fortunate I chose to go there for my full knee replacement therapy.  From my first visit I felt so welcomed and comfortable.  I was amongst an entire staff that truly cared about me and my progress.  They worked side by side with me.  I wasn‚Äôt left to do it on my own.  Their professionalism and knowledge was very reassuring.  I could not thank them enough.  I highly recommend Benchmark!
"BenchMark Physical Therapy in Canton, Ga certainly exceeded my expectations. The therapists and assistants are first class! My neck issues got resolved and now I have no pain.  I would strongly recommend them."
"The staff maintained professionalism but created a very personal atmosphere. Daniel and the rest of the staff always listened to my concerns, answered questions, and tailored therapy to my needs to ensure success. Any future or recurring needs I would request to go through them."
"My dad does not have a Google account and asked that I post this review for him:

I worked with Sam Hall on a severe Pain in my Hip.  Sam diagnosed the problem and worked with me on isolated exercises for the affected area, along with Dry Needling.  After several weeks, I no longer have Hip Pain, and have resumed normal activities.  Sam provided a maintenance plan.  He is ‚ÄúExtremely Knowledgeable‚Äù and been a tremendous help to me.

I have been to many Physical Therapists over the years - for various sports injuries.  Sam is the ‚ÄúAbsolute Best‚Äù I have ever worked with.  He really cares about helping patients achieve results!

The support staff at this location were also extremely cordial and a pleasure to work with.  I would highly recommend this Benchmark Location!

Albert ‚ÄúAllen‚Äù English"
Just an exceptional staff!!! Highly Highly recommended!! Helped me through my second TKR in a years time with outstanding results. This crew helped me through a critical time in my life and I would return in a flash!!
"Great atmosphere and very caring! It was the first time I needed physical therapy and didn‚Äôt really know what to expect. Daniel is very attentive, knowledgeable, and supportive. Everyone is helpful and cheerful and you not only feel that you are making progress recovering from an injury, but also that you are part of their friendly team. I highly recommend them."
"All of the staff is wonderful and the atmosphere is very uplifting. I worked mainly with Klay and he is excellent. I got more out of the experience than just feeling better physically. When I ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù I was sad as I wouldn‚Äôt be seeing everyone again. I plan to stop by and say hi sometime though. If you need physical therapy, I would thoroughly recommend them."
"I had total knee replacement a month ago and needed therapy. A friend recommended Benchmark
And how happy I am! Daniel and Klay have been outstanding therapist, great guys too! The group of trainers are wonderful!
Hanna always welcomes you with a smile and is happy to help with all your questions.
This group is serious about getting you well and back to a healthy life!  I highly recommend Benchmark!!!"
Amazing experience. Very supportive and comforting people. They always do their best to help.
"Backstory: i dislocated my elbow playing football back in early October of 2019 and luckily nothing was broken and it was only a dislocation. Fast forward to December 12, 2019 it was my last appointment with them and i have been very satisfied with their work. I never thought i would've been able to recover this fast, but thanks to their amazing work I am fully healthy and ready to hit the field! :)"
"Excellent guidance support from Daniel, Halley and the Benchmark Team that helped me achieve my rehab goals."
Daniel and his team helped me gain the confidence to start my active lifestyle after a car accident. They displayed genuine concern and compassion all throughout my treatment.  I would recommend them again and again to anyone requiring physical therapy. Thanks again friends!
"I was referred to Daniel by a PT from the BenchMark Athens location, after a negative experience at another physical therapy (not BenchMark) clinic. What a difference! Daniel worked out a treatment plan for my neck pain and within a couple of months I had made tremendous progress and feel so much better. He is very experienced, compassionate, and knowledgeable in his craft, and I felt that he truly cared about my physical and mental recovery. I have new exercises that will continue to work on even though I have completed my physical therapy here. Everyone at this clinic from the front desk, to the assistants, to the therapists, are professional, helpful, friendly, and caring. I would 100% come here again and would recommend them to any of my friends and family."
The positive experience began with the first phone call and the time and care I was given by Hannah to establish my future care at Benchmark. During my 3+ months of treatment I was treated by all the PTs and assisted by the techs. Everyone spent time with me to help be progress in getting better. My primary PT was Daniel and he was awesome. He pushed me but was always intune to how much i could handle. It was bittersweet when my care of completed. I highly recommend this facility and all the caregivers involved.
"What gentle care. They listen, believe the level of pain you describe, and know how to fix it. Klay was great. And the whole staff is very nice. I highly recommend this practice."
Absolutely the best PT group out there. The team is well qualified and motivated to help you meet your goals. Great rapport with patients.
"Daniel, Klay, and everyone else is so nice! I just completed therapy and a broken ankle and they were all wonderful. They make sure you're healing but constantly check to be sure you're comfortable and not in pain. I hope to never need PT again, but if I do, I won't hesitate to go back to them!"
I would recommend Benchmark to anyone needing physical therapy. The atmosphere of the clinic is so positive and the staff is very friendly. The team at Benchmark has made me feel like family over the course of my many injuries and I will keep coming back because of it. I refuse to go anywhere else for physical therapy.
"Great service!
The staff is kind and attentive. My therapist Daniel is knowledgeable and caring. I love them all.!!
You won't  be disappointed."
"Klay was my therapist, he was very compassionate and knowledgeable therapist. I really enjoyed him approach. Everyone from the office is very kind and professional."
"Great atmosphere and very professional. Daniel is genuinely concerned for every one of his patients! I received very thorough physical therapy  with amazing results! I'm so happy with the services I received that I'm referring my wife for care as well.

You're going to love the therapists and staff at this location! Get ready for a wonderful experience."
"Great experience with Sam and staff at Holly Springs Benchmark! My knee is so much better and Sam has given me all the tools and advice to keep it strong. Thank you Benchmark!! And a big thanks to Dr. Yvonne Satterwhite, Resurgens!"
My experience here has been amazing! They have worked with me for months to get my ankle back to as close to normal as possible! I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for Klay and all he has done to help me!
"This is my first time to have physical therapy and I was greeted  with cheerful hello's and lovely smiles. My therapist Klay was amazing and was very helpful with my treatment.  To Hanna, Hayley, Q and all the staff thank you for outstanding treatment."
"What  fabulous therapists, Klay and Daniel are. They are exceptional and very professional. Hanna, office coordinator, Jessica and Emma the techs are terrific They all make you feel comfortable and they are all very aware of ""your situation""  i will miss them.  Thank y'all"
"I have never had physical therapy nor been to a facility, so I did not know what to expect from this experience.  What I found was a truly remarkable group of caring people who have helped me enormously.  Thanks especially to Klay as well as all the staff, as they have all helped me to significantly improve!"
"Very very good! The employees are so friendly, they always make you feel welcomed. Daniel was amazing with helping to reduce my back pain! Would highly recommend coming!!"
"Daniel and his staff are not only top-notch therapists, but make you feel welcome.  I was more than ""just another patient"" there.  The treatment I received alleviated ALL of my shoulder pain, and I'm back up and running.  Definitely my  new Go-To Physical Therapist!"
This has been quite the experience. First surgery and physical therapy. Wonderful experience here at Benchmark. Love the staff there. They provide a challenging but fun environment to get work done. They provide excellent hospitality and truly have a love for the people they work with! I have overcome to many obstacles working with Scott. He pushes me and is confident in my potential. Sara and Emma are just wonderful and make sure you are comfortable while there. Highly recommend to anyone. Stop by for free consultations! You won't be disappointed!!
Daniel & Klay were great therapist in helping me rehab after my knee replacement surgery.  The entire team was great.  It's been just under 2 months since my surgery and I and walked a mile today with my wife.  I highly recommend this group for their professionalism.
Benchmark is helping me to achieve long-term health benefits optimizing my quality of life! It‚Äôs the staffs attention to detail and their patient centered approach that makes a real difference. Thank you Benchmark!
Excellent care . This therapy help me recover from complicated foot fructure.  They expertise help me recover much quicker then it was expected. I am 76 years old . I very much recomend  for anyone to use their facility.  Thank you for taking great care of me. Danut Roszczyk
My experience so far is absolutely wonderful.  The hospitality first and far most make you feel so good the first thing in the morning.  Everyone here gets the highest mark from me.  Thank you
VERY PROFESSIONAL STAFF. ABOVE AND BEYOND THE EXPECTATIONS. THERAPY WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN REGULAR SESSIONS.
"They were very caring, helpful, and professional. I would highly recommend Beanchmark PT in Holly Springs."
"I want to thank Daniel and Klay and the entire Benchmark Physical Therapy staff at Holly Springs for helping me recover from my serious injury to my leg.  Their knowledge, kindness, support, and encouragement helped me greatly! Thanks so much for everything!"
Dedicated to your recovery!  My second round with them due to two separate surgeries.  Sympathetic to your pain.  Professional.  Highly recommend.
very friendly and helpful therapists. Got me back up and running in no time.
"I had a pain growing in my back issue which needed something to stop or at least control it. My specialist Doctor sent me to BenchMark for potential help on getting the pain down and They helped Much!!!
All of the folks working at BenchMark were very kind and helpful and in a few days I felt the pain going down.
I do advise trying BenchMark if you have pain on your body as.... if it works for you you will not have to potentially have the side effects from some medicines as well as the side effect from med operations which can be a negative result for you."
everyone has been awesome. I will definately be back if I need therapy ever again..
Clay and the staff were fantastic!  They kept the sessions fun. Great results!
All the staff is great and makes you feel at home. You will Love it here.
Been to this facility for three different problems.  Always leave feeling better and with exercises to continue my journey to health.  Thank you Daniel and all at BenchMark
"this place really works when i had my knee replace and wasn't doing to good before i came to therapy, they really done a fantasy job fixing my leg! i would recommend them to any one for joint pain, they really done a good job for me"
"I tore my mcl skiing and was prescribed rehab to return to prior form. Being athletic and in my early 30s, I was skeptical that PT would be able to add something I couldn't do at the gym. I was wrong. I learned a ton and was challenged at Benchmark. The therapists tailored a plan for me and even gave me additional workouts for the gym. More over, they truly cared about my recovery... checking in frequently. I also liked that they remembered my kids names and asked about other activities in my life. They cared about my physical and mental rehabilitation after the injury. I can't recommend Klay and Daniel highly enough."
"Everyone here is extremely cheerful, and did an amazing job with helping me with my pain! Highly recommend coming here!"
"friendly,clean, well staffed, Klay was fantastic"
"I went in with a torn ACL, MCL, meniscus and sprained PCL. I could bend my knee only slightly with pain.  After a few weeks with Klay and sometimes Daniel, I could bend my knee within a 5 degree difference from the opposite knee.  The entire staff are kind, very attentive, and knowledgeable.  Happy to have been referred to this amazing group."
Clay and staff did an excellent job working with my neck pain and teaching me exercises going forward. I would highly recommend BenchMark at Hickory Flat.
Great knowledgeable staff.  They listen and pay attention to the patient's condition at all times.  Their upbeat and encouraging attitude creates a positive atmosphere for getting better.
everyone absolutely fantastic! they check on you constantly and always seem to really care about the whole person.
I enjoyed my therapy.  very nice people.











"Below are my before and after therapy pictures from my complete left knee replacement surgery. When I first started therapy, I was literally afraid to try anything. Cierra was very patient and knowledgeable in gearing exercises  that would benefit my progress. I never wanted to disappoint her and always strived to accomplish each exercise she presented to me.  She is a phenomenal asset to the Benchmark therapy organization.  That you Cierra and Benchmark for my wonderful, positive sessions."
"Since my injury occurred, I‚Äôve been tossed around like the greenest lettuce in the salad bowl of doctors.  Upon my arrival to Benchmark Ellenwood though, all the way up until my last day, I felt safe, secure, and well taken care of for sure.
Dr Thornton is kind, professional, focused, and GIFTED in her field. Doctors can study and obtain all the knowledge in the field of medicine, but when you find one that is naturally gifted, you‚Äôve struck gold, because a gift cannot be learned. I‚Äôm so grateful. The staff are kind, professional and thorough as well. Hands down the best all the way around. Cheers to restoration and wellness! I highly recommend this establishment!"
"Omg! There isn't words to describe Benchmarks. Everyone is so nice  and they patient with you and the results are amazing if you follow their directions.  I know that people have reservations about therapy but  let me tell you benchmark will change your mind. So if your looking for a peaceful,  relaxing and get things done this is the place."
"My therapist was amazing and she treated me with the upmost respect, Noah was great and she cared about my well being. Thanks Benchmark."
"This BenchMark location is Excellent! The customer service is AWESOME. All of the therapists are knowledgeable and great at what they do, especially in helping me to meet my goals after surgery."
"The therapists are caring,  compassionate and committed to helping their patients achieve their goals!üôÇ"
I have used Bench Mark in different locations and each time regardless of location the staff from the time you enter is always professional.  Not only to me but to everyone else  that  come into the clinic . Many thanks to the staff.
"I came here to heal & I got that! The team was so warm, which made coming in every wk that much more doable! My hour would fly by & my progress was that much easier. From the front desk (Nadia & Nicole), to my physical therapist (Megan), to the manager (Remi)! I‚Äôm finished with treatment & I recommend BenchMark (Ellenwood) to anyone who‚Äôs looking for exceptional treatment !!"
They are very thorough and detailed about the service they provide. I highly  recommend using them.
"OMG best PT experience ever. Professional, friendly, excellent and best of all in my neighborhood. It matters to have access so close to home. Thank you Benchmark Ellenwood, you changed my life! Keep up the great work!"
You couldn‚Äôt ask for anything better because they are the best! I came in with a walker and I left out walking without one. They are the best. I highly recommend their services.
"I have thoroughly enjoyed my rehab experience at the Benchmark Physical Therapy at Fairview Road location starting with the front office staff:  Nadia and Nichole consistent friendly and heartfelt greetings.  I have appreciated the professionalism and friendly rapport that I have obtained with my Physical Therapist, Meagan!  The management and pleasant environment that is exemplary lead by the office staff manager, Remi!  I would recommend this particular office to anyone that ask.  Love the environment and suggestion for exercising at home to assist in my recovery."
"This place is efficient, friendly, knowledgeable and organized. It‚Äôs not just clean, it‚Äôs clean clean!!! Better than the a regular place it‚Äôs like Starbucks of Physical therapy locations but cleaner. I absolutely loved my visit and cannot wait to come back!!!"
"First, thank you to the Ellenwood Benchmark staff, from the beginning they showed excellent customer service and knowledge of rehabilitation techniques. I am very satisfied with work the staff did with my daughter‚Äôs shoulder rehab. therapy. I will definitely use this staff again and recommend them to others. Thank you Thank you Thank you"
Wonderful and friendly staff!
"Kia was amazing helping me with my recovery.  I came in unsure and discouraged about my progress and she was able to nurse me back to health (Yes, I actually did my exercises at home.)  I appreciate everyone at their facility and I'm ready to put this behind me!"
Professional/knowledgeable staff. Welcoming atmosphere.
"Benchmark physical therapy is awesome. Kia and Remi worked with me following my knee replacement surgery. I have had an easy recovery thanks to them.  They know the right techniques to get you to your recovery goals. Also, if I I was not having a good day they knew how to not have a painful session. Give them my highest recommendation."
"These young ladies are knowledgable. From day one they have been attentive and courteous professionals.  They are a motivated group of young ladies. They show great team work.

Its is an amazing environment here and would highly recomend."
"This was my mom and I first time at this location and I enjoyed it! I think she enjoyed it as well. The employees are nice and warm, especially Mrs. Allen (at the front desk.)"
"I didn‚Äôt know what to expect coming to Benchmark Physical Therapy but the entire staff made me feel comfortable and relaxed from the 2 receptionist Jazmine and Nicole to the 2 therapists that attended to my care, Remi and Kia.  I came in with severe pain in my arm; keeping me up at night but today as I‚Äôm getting ready to leave, I must say I am completely satisfied with the attention and care I have received here.  These 2 ladies even massaged a knot from my arm.  I will highly recommend Benchmark and if I ever need future physical therapy, this is where I‚Äôm coming.  Thank you to the excellence shown by the staff at Benchmark!
DCW"
Absolutely wonderful staff. Making great progress and I sincerely thank Remi for her hard work.
"After having knee surgery,  I needed physical therapy and attended Benchmark in Ellenwood. I was in pain and skeptical but Austin and the Awesome staff made the sessions effective and pleasant. The other patients were also pleasant. From the reception to the therapist, always professional and curteous. I am now back to work and feeling great!!!"
I‚Äôve done therapy things at Benchmark that I‚Äôve never done at other therapy places.  Only one thing. They don‚Äôt have any equipment that helps one stand up.
Remi is the best.






"I have been working with Dominique Maharath, PT, DPT to rehab my shoulder post-op.  Dom is extremely knowledgeable and has a great approach and balance in explaining and being hands on with all my exercises.  I am so pleased with my progress over the last 8 weeks and excited about the improvement for my quality of life with my shoulder.  The staff has been great!  Masks and all to help make my visits enjoyable and personable.  Thank you Mike Henry for referring me to this awesome BenchMark location."
"Great experience during rehab of shoulder after surgery.  Was a pleasure working with Pavel.  He is knowledgeable, considerate of your progress/status at all times, while still pushing to make the best use of your time in rehab.  Would highly recommend BenchMark and Pavel."
"I have been visiting this location for about a year now. The people in this location have made a difficult situation brighter. I could not have chosen a better place to heal from my injury. From the moment call and schedule your first appointment, the reception is warm and welcoming. Kelly Ann is always so bubbly and friendly. You may even her ""Happy Friday"" on a Monday, which will bring a smile to your face if you let it wash over you.
As you are ushered back to start your therapy, you are met with conversation and sometimes even coffee as they have some of the nicest guys there to bring you back to your therapist. The therapist always take the time to listen to your needs and create a plan to make you better. When you are finished and leave you will walk out with confidence you are in good hands.
Again, I am very fortunate to have found such a caring and loving atmosphere to recover. I love you guy more than you'll ever know. Thank you so much for all the blessing you have brought into my life."
"Every time I walk in the door of Benchmark, I am welcomed by people that I know are actually invested in my physical health.  They work well as a team, which is reflected in the smiles on their faces and how they interact with the patients.  I will most likely need PT for the rest of my life due to a chronic condition and I trust Pavel Gorokhov implicitly.  He does an excellent job listening to me and adjusting my therapy as needed.  This is a busy clinic, but KellyAnn, does a phenomenal job multi-tasking, even pitching in with directing patients with exercises when needed."
"My physical therapist was Megan Eisenberg and she was phenomenal.  She was very informative from the beginning of my sessions until the very end.  She not only told me what to do, she demonstrated the exercise so I did it correctly.  She was there with me the whole time and took the effort to make sure I was progressing properly.  The thing that put Megan over the top was that she truly cared about me and the progress I was making.  If you‚Äôre looking for a physical therapist, go to this location and ask for Megan, you won‚Äôt me disappointed."
"I injured my spine and hip recently, and when I ""walked"" in for my first appointment I could barely make it to my own mailbox.  I'd never dealt with PT before.

The progress I've made over the last month has been fantastic, and while I have much further to go, I couldn't have done it without the crew at BenchMark.  Thank you very much to them, and I can't recommend them highly enough."
"I‚Äôve been coming to Benchmark on Alpharetta Highway for a few months now for a long-term problem I‚Äôve had for a few years. I‚Äôve seen steady progress and improvement in my strength and reduction in my pain.

My occupational therapist Maggie is just fantastic. Just five minutes with her will show you how much she genuinely cares. Therapists usually take measurements at the start and end of treatment but Maggie is constantly asking for feedback on how I‚Äôm doing and she modifies the treatment and exercises based on my needs and your progress. She keeps things fresh so that I don‚Äôt fall into a repetitive routine and she comes up with novel techniques to help me. She has also given me several stretches and exercises to help me at home. Besides her competence, skills, and caring attitude, Maggie is really a nice person! She puts you at ease with her smile and maintains a positive attitude.

The clinic director, Dr. Pavel, is also great. He‚Äôs also a hands-on physical therapist and he does the dry needling on me. He‚Äôs invariably in a good mood and when your body is literally in his hands you can tell that you‚Äôre in the hands of an expert. Lastly, Dr. Pavel has a great rapport with both his patients and his staff. Unless you specifically asked, you‚Äôd never know that he was the ‚Äúboss‚Äù because while he treats his staff with respect and professionalism, he also maintains a light atmosphere and he treats them as his colleagues, not as people who work ‚Äúfor him‚Äù. My only complaint is that he can‚Äôt remember the correct punchlines to jokes. :)

Lastly, I‚Äôve never had this clinic call me to cancel or reschedule because a staff member was out or unavailable or some other reason. This shows how reliable they are and that the people who work there enjoy being there."
"The entire staff and all of the therapists are outstanding. They are professional, highly knowledgeable and genuinely care about each individual. I have been impressed with all of the physical therapists and the occupational therapists skills. The approach is truly one of collaboration and a joint effort to ensure the highest outcome to reach the maximum potential of their clients. I recommend this clinic as one of the best!"
"The people are what make this place special. They are always knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. The fact that they know what they are doing is icing on the cake! No matter who I see, I leave here feeling better every time. I highly recommend BPT!"
"Pavel and his team are top notch and provide the best customer service I've experienced in a very long time. They are knowledgeable, helpful, compassion and fun - which means that in addition to feeling better physically, I'm in a better mood after every session. Don't hesitate, go to this location - I literally drive past two other BenchMark's just to work with Pavel and his team - they are the absolute best."
"Intake process was good and thorough with Ross, my issue is the the scheduling. When you have an appointment the therapist is working with other people and  sometimes several others during the hour your paying for. Leads to downtime and standing around waiting, if the time slot is taken they should tell you and you can find another time. Maybe my expectations are too high but I expect better service."
My experience with Benchmark Physical Therapy in Alpharetta has been a great experience from all the staff members. I would definitely recommend them! Thanks
I can't say enough good things about the treatment and professional service I received at Benchmark. Everyone there is so helpful and friendly.
Very knowledgeable and empathetic staff with primary concern their patients‚Äô well-being and improvement.
"I have been Suffering from shoulder injury for the past Four years, and when I finally decided to do something about it, I  made the right choice of Physical therapy.
the staff are very friendly and caring. I had the pleasure to be trained by Dan, Erica , and Alex.
they are the most caring and friendly people i have ever met in my life.
my goal of getting better and doing better became their goal from the first visit and they helped me to achieve my goal. they are experts in their field and quickly identified my strength and weak points.
they respected my time and daily schedule and made sure I take the most advantage of the every minutes that I spent with them.
after 5 weeks of therapy the results were unlivable, I walked in the BenchMark having difficulties sleeping and moving my shoulder, but when my five weeks ended my pain was gone, i was stronger and even attended two Tae Kwon Do matches with no issues.
my level of injury was minor in comparison with many others who seek therapy but I am sure with dedication and time they will improve and have their normal life back."
Therapists are dedicated to their patients and very knowledgeable.






Raki was very great to work with and was able to go at my pace. After four weeks with her I was able to get back to my very best. The staff is very professional and will absolutely surpass your expectations!
Well I was one of their first patient . I broke my left leg and needed to start walking after surgery . I was using both crutches when I started therapy . A week after therapy I was walking without the crutches . They really helped me to get back on my feet . My doctor was very nice and caring . They helped me reached my goals n I will always appreciate them for this .
I have to say I had my doubts before visiting BenchMark for Lymphedema therapy and wrapping.  Raakhee Patel worked miracles on my legs. My legs now have some shape and with Raakhee's advice I am able to keep the swelling down.  I am so very grateful to have had therapy at BenchMark PT provided by Raakhee Patel (10).  I highly recommend BenchMark PT and Raakhee Patel.
Great place if you‚Äôre in need of rehab I recommend this location 100%‚Ä¶ Great staff that really helps make a difference! I honestly never believed in therapy centers until now!
"This is by far the best clinic in the greater Atlanta area for all your physical therapy needs. Raakhee is very patient and attentive, and her bedside manner really stands out from everyone else. The level of professionalism in this clinic is truly unparalleled, and that is coming from someone who has many years' experience in health care as both a patient and employee. The facility itself is spotless and the bathrooms are always clean. The tables are wiped down thoroughly between every patient. I feel very safe in the clinic. Raakhee is very well-versed in her craft. She is orthopedic residency trained and also treats patients with lymphedema. The next time you need physical therapy, definitely schedule an appointment with Raakhee!"


Excellent  therapy and therapist.  U was in bad shape and they got me pretty close to normal.
"Morrow BenchMark has been apart of my prep and recovery for knee replacement years ago. I'm back with other issues and am receiving the same professional and successful therapy as experienced and expect.
My current PT therapist first gave me hope of recovery when I was resigned to live with limited mobility and pain.  He has seen me 6 times and I have been improving with less pain and much more mobility already!
I thank God for all the concerned staff to help me get back to physically activity and over all good health!"
My therapist took me from a sling to breaking bands...Austin rocks!!!
"Jason is my therapist, and he provides a great therapeutic plans for me in the center as well as a home plan!!!"
"My workers comp requested this location after tearing my ACL. Its a nice location, friendly people. Just unsuccessful in assist with needed care after ACL surgical repairs."

This is an amazing team of dedicated and skilled physical therapists. Everyone is very friendly and that helps you to relax and work on getting better.
I loved Benchmark the receptionist was very friendly and nice and made you feel welcome and the therapist all therapist was very friendly they acknowledge you when you came in made you feel welcome. The therapist I had was very helpful. I will definitely go back there if need be.
I LOVE  BENCHMARK PHYSICAL  THERAPY.  THE WHOLE  TEAM WAS GREAT.  I PROMISE  TO RECOMMEND  YOU GUYS TO OTHERS.  THANK  YOU  GUYS FOR  EVERYTHING üíïüíïüíïüíï
All of the therapists and even the receptionists are very nice and helpful. The new location is double the size of the old one which feels a lot better. The exercises I was taught help my pain on days I don't go to therapy.
Stevie Kristen Steve anitrius and Kawana are the best.  I feel welcome every time and like I'm treated with great concern for my well-being opposed to being another spoke on the Wheel
"The therapist are incredible, great at their craft and very pleasant."





"Great PT!  I strongly recommend Benchmark in Bethlehem. Devon and Diane are wonderful therapist. I had total knee replacement three weeks ago and thanks to them I‚Äôm moving as though it never happened. Friendly, caring and kind."
Jenny is exceptional.  the care you get at benchmark becklehem is far above average. I Have used them 4 different times over 5 years. I've always been pleased. This most recent time I went in with severe pack pain that I had had for several years and within 8 weeks I was Pain free
"Not sure how to say this, but for me this place has been AMAZING!!! John is nothing short of INCREDIBLE!!!! The rest of the staff are wonderful!!! I can't say enough good things about these folks!!!!"
I have spent a lot of time as a patient at benchmark. Because of my stubborn knee it has taken a lot of work. The therapist at benchmark have all been incredible. They are hardworking and dedicated to their craft
"This is a well organized, patient focused essential facility. The PT Staff is absolutely wonderful in their approaches to help their patients. The clinical knowledge base is unbelievable! Jessica is my current Therapist and is wonderful regarding how she has helped to alleviate my pain. The non-clinical Staff i.e,Brittany and Emily also always go that extra mile to help, on each visit."
Great People! Everyone is so caring and supportive. They helped me more rotation in my body after a bad wreck. My DR wanted me to stop due to seizures. I will be back here after I have surgery. Going to miss chatting with everyone.
"An awesome staff who will work with you to get your body back to 100%
They've almost become like family and it's sad to see my PT completed.

I strongly advocate for anyone who has an injury or surgery to make an appointment and come in and let them work their magic on you,"
Awesome experience here.. Audrey is very kind and personable. They have created a great pleasant atmosphere inside this BenchMark Physical Therapy facility. I highly recommend!!
I have used them for both knee replacements and when minor surgery was done to try to keep from having to have replacement surgery.  ALL of the teams are wonderful.  They push you to do your best and will not let you over do it.  It is always clean.  Even before the Covid outbreak.  If I could they would get 10 üåü stars.
"Great place for re hab. Everyone is professional and very positive. If you're lucky you'll get to work with Jessica, she says she's a rookie... World class in my opinion."
"K.C. Thomas does a fantastic job. I highly reccommend her. She is always busy, but always has the time to help you."
"everyone was very positive and very helpful only problem i had was they didn,t enforce the wearing of masks which the sign at the door instructed them to do all else was great and helpful thanks everyone"
"I am thrilled to have been referred to Benchmark. I could hardly turn my head for 8 months.  Started physical therapy and within a few days I was already getting relief. I stayed with it and continue to do my physical therapy and am now playing ball with my small children. I am so thankful for the care and knowledge I received. I highly recommend this establishment. A blessing to me and my family!!!! Thank you so much!!!!!!

"I had knee surgery and went to BenchMark to regain range of motion. The staff were all  wonderful and I always looked forward to going. The first knee surgery, I had  wonderful results and I'm with them now to get the same results on the second surgery. KC, you are wonderful!!!"
"This is a great PT group. They are very upbeat and professional. They know your limits and push you to them. The atmosphere is positive and makes me want to work at getting better. Give them a try, you won't be sorry!"
I cannot speak highly enough for this clinic and staff that have worked on my fused vertebrae  in my neck. For the first time in 15 years I can turn my head without my whole body with no pain. I love that they have a maintenance program. Thank you BenchMark!
This was my first experience with physical therapy.   Having heard horror stories from friends and family members I was a bit nervous.  The experience has been nothing but positive.  I will actually be a bit sad when it's over.  Everyone here is professional and compassionate they want you to succeed but don't want you in pain.
"Everyone here is great! The therapists, techs and office staff are all extremely knowledgeable and hardworking. They will go the extra mile for you and your recovery. This is the least awkward healthcare environment that I have ever been in. Highly recommended!"
This place has helped me greatly. The staff continues to work to help me get relief. Great place!
This is a special place. All the staff are extremely knowledgeable and helpful. A great environment. I highly recommend it.
"I was having some back pain, and Audrey was able to see me through Direct Access. I received great care and excellent advice allowing me to continue my rehab at home!"
K.C. Thomas provided my mom (Julie) with  the best physical therapy experience she has ever had.  Helped her reach her goals and provided her with exercises to continue at home.  Thanks!
They are extremely helpful and professional. Have been wonderful with us.
"Helped me get my knee better, nice people and they are very patient."
Love Stevie she is awesome always dancing and in a great mood
This place offers excellent therapists and care. I have received more pain relief here than any doctor's office!
Excellent care with excellent results!
Great place awesome people





"I am a repeat ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù of Clinic Director Steven Hightshue‚Äôs highly professional therapy regimens.  I hobbled in and and weeks later walked out feeling virtually back to normal.  Steven is an exceptionally focused healer and I am very grateful to him for his work.
This time, after getting me into my routine and constantly monitoring my progress, Steven later turned me over to his Intern, Sarah Ann King.  Sarah explained each exercise clearly, it‚Äôs reason, and could not have been more attentive to me and my progress.  I am thrilled with her work as well.  I expect she will be a successful clinic Director herself.  Thank you Sarah for helping me and to Steven and Benchmark for making my experience so fruitful.  These guys are good!"
Staff was always kind and friendly during my three months of physical therapy. They always seemed happy to see me and were very professional in a relaxed way. Definitely recommend this location.
"Staff is very friendly and so does Mary who did my PT. She's very good at treating two conditions at the same time for my lower back as well as knee. Thank you Mary and all the staff. Front desk manages schedules, insurance, doct office paper work/follow up, etc, very effectively."
Thank you Lana!! Your help is so appreciated!  :D
"Sarah has been helping rehab my knee after surgery for a little over a month and I've had great results so far. Even with a roomful of people undergoing various treatments, she is able to keep everything running pretty smoothly without seeming overwhelmed. And Christie at the front desk has always been very welcoming to me and always seems to be willing to help lend a hand whether it is cleaning off tables, helping patients ice down, or even provide a helping hand in some of the exercises as needed. Facilities are nice and clean and the equipment seems to be in good, clean, working condition."
"We had great experience all the staff members are great it's welcomy .
Sarah and Andrea are very professionally with knowledge do taking care of they will do understand and pay attention to make sure you get feel better soon. I had taking my two boys after car accident and we are very happy I do highly do recommend.
Thanks Sarah and Andrea and all the staff members."
I see Sara as part of my total hip replacement physical therapy and she is wonderful. Great personality and very educational experience (I learned a lot about my condition and other).
"Best PTs ever!!!  Their HQ and Billing is horrendous.  The people that work there are awesome, they educate, they listen, and do everything in their power to help you be better.  Very under appreciated.

The company itself does not care.  Hence my 1 star, but a 10 star staff.  Thank you to the PTs, no thanks to Benchmark."
"The staff at this location are wonderful caring people. If you ever need physical therapy, this is the place."

This is for the Jackson location bad experience physical therapist anytime I try go get in touch with the office it‚Äôs like impossible. I have to drive to the location which takes 30 minutes to be told they do not have me down on the schedule not sure why since I was to have standing appointment every Tuesday. The physical therapist which already was not very personable and frankly always looked like she rolled out of bed just told me sorry and said I can‚Äôt see you today not really caring at all! I said how does this happen my appointment is to be in every Tuesday‚Äù she just said not sure you aren‚Äôt on the schedule‚Äô‚Äù and asked the the other patient if they were ready and was very dismissive! I care not to back to this location again.
"Absolutely love the Physical therapist and receptionist at the office! They are amazing, considerate and very knowledgeable. I would recommend them highly"
The Physical therapist is great and so is the receptionist.
Good people and understanding your pain and stay focus on your comeback great staff you getting well and back to normal is they first concern thank you for my return to normal.
"the staff is very professional and well trained, also helpful with making sure the exercises  helped with my needs for getting better."
"The therapist did a very thorough assessment of my husband, who had extensive cervical spine surgery, and  then made a comprehensive, detailed care plan for rehab. She works with him twice a week,  and after 4 sessions,  my husband's  pain level has improved and his mobility and posture are  noticeably better. Through taping,  dry needling,  and varied exercises, we are looking  forward to much more  progress in the  coming weeks."
The people at this facility are wonderful. They truely care about your well being and progress.  They are like a family.  Very warm and caring!
Great location close to home. Therapist is excellent. Easy in and out.
Physical therapist who is very knowledgeable and friendly willing to help with anything give you information for use at home as well office Very motivating creates a great atmosphere




"First time here. Located in Dunwoody. Very nice place. The employee entrance is the first driveway on the right. Patient entrance is at the light. Social distance signs and office times are visible. Automatic doors open to 2 different sides. Both are very clean and have markings on the floor. The staff was super friendly and nice. Dr. O has pictures of himself in the office I was in with a soccer team. Very nice person. The procedure was thoroughly explained step by step and an ultrasound was used for accuracy. I was sprayed with lidocaine to ensure it would be painless. I believe I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. If I had to go back I would. They treated me very well. So if you ever need an in-house procedure, this is the place to go. Check out my video and pics for more information"
I am disappointed in the service that I received here.  This center is understaffed. The physical therapist treat 4 to 5 patients at the same time of your treatment. I was sent to the corner to exercise while she was helping the patients who are laying on the treatment table.  My insurance is paying for a treatment - I should get so time with the Therapist.
Good therapist.

"My experience with the therapist, Jacqueline, at the Johnson Ferry location has been excellent. She explains the causal  effect and the expected outcome of each application and technique.  She is pleasant, professional, and obviously competent."
Highly recommend Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center. My physical therapist is Kendall Huff.  I wasn't so sure how Covid Quarantine Telehealth therapy would work but I am so impressed at the quality of care I am receiving and appreciate the in-depth research and therapy sessions Kendall  leads me through. Thank you Kendall! Thank you Emory Rehab!
Very nice place.  Small and intimate.   Enjoyed being there.
"Emory Hospital has several Rehabilitation Outpatient Centers, but I‚Äôm so pleased that I chose the facility on 1100 Johnson Ferry Road in Marietta.  The staff is so professional, and the atmosphere is always light hearted and positive.
Charlotte, the Physical Therapist I mainly see, is very knowledgeable.  She takes the opportunity to educate you, as to ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you‚Äôre doing a certain exercise or, ‚Äúwhy‚Äù certain modalities are being used.  She is also very positive and compassionate, with a good conversation, and has good intentions toward the clients; which is ""half the battle being won"", when you‚Äôre trying to get through pain. I‚Äôve found that to be the general consensus when talking to other clients too. Again, I‚Äôm very pleased with my choice.
T. Hudson"
"VERY awesome and professional! The BEST orthopedic surgeon in the state! Reliable, friendly, CARING and always on the patients level! Would highly HIGHLY recommend!! Dr Tarabadkar is the best hand surgeon and really knows the best! Fixed my broken bones lightning fast! Has called me to check on me personally a few times! It really shows how much they care about their patients and not just the numbers or money! When you make patient care as number 1, it really shows!"
I have received excellent treatment from Margaret.  She adapts each session to whatever I need. She‚Äôs the best!
"I could not have been more pleased with my experience at Emory Rehabilitation. The service was prompt, courteous, personable, and I always felt completely comfortable during the entire process. My therapist, Marge, made sure that I understood all the exercises I was supposed to do. It was evident that both my comfort and rehabilitation were very important to her. I can‚Äôt recommend them enough!!"
I have used Emory Rehab in East Cobb twice now and had a great experience both times.  I worked with Charlotte on shoulder pain recently and she is very good at what she does and does not push you beyond your limits.  Always before when going to PT I found the other places I had been to made things worse instead of better.  This is not the case with Emory PT. I would highly recommend Charlotte and Emory.
Love my physical therapist Margaret Krengel!!  She made me feel so safe and secure coming off a major trip and fall breaking two bones!! I had immediate improvement in my first session!  All the staff were so personable !  Great vibes everywhere!  I highly recommend Emory Rehab !!!
"This team is awesome!  As a patient with cervical, andh as a patient with cervical and lumbar spine  issues along with osteoarthritis  I have had, unfortunately, a great deal experience with physical therapy teams   The Emory rehabilitation team is certainly one of the best I‚Äôve ever worked with!   Administrative staff is great in scheduling and flexible in their approach.   Charlotte, my lead physical therapist, has been a critical player in keeping me up and moving about! She listens and she cares! These are the two most important traits of a great physical therapist. After she listens and cares, she designs a program that fits my specific needs.  Marge, the hand therapist had been a critical player in minimizing the impact of arthritis in my hands and other joints.
Their other therapists  are  equally adept st meeting my needs. I cannot recommendation the Emory Outpatient team highly enough.
Dave Studeman"
Charlotte is wonderful!  I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with the PT treatment that I received. And her assessment of my injury was 100% correct. I wholeheartedly recommend Charlotte and her staff.
"It‚Äôs been a very rough year or so. Two falls basically ruined my left leg. The first one damaged the bones that transferred motion from the hip area to the leg. The second destroyed the lower part of the fulmar.
The team at Emory‚Äôs rehab center returned me to ‚Äònormal‚Äô just in time to begin work on the second disaster.
We are in week three of rehab and I‚Äôve already improved from a 60 degree bend to a 85 degree bend. The goal is 120 degrees.

The team knows what to do or where to find the newest techniques.  Or they fake it extremely well.

There is pain, but the pain goes away as I progress thru rehab."
"Great experience! Physical therapy had a tremendous impact. Also, the therapists were easy to work with and committed to success."
Emory rehab has very knowledgeable therapists. They listen to your concerns and issues. They have been very helpful to me. Would highly recommend them.
Emily was friendly and knowledgeable.  She gave me exercises which provided relief from the pain in my shoulder.
Amazing group of people who truly care about rehabbing their patients. Thank you for everything!
"Friendly staff, knowledgable therapists and a healing/encouraging atmosphere. Highly recommend."
a great care team to assist in your recovery !!
Great PT! She listened to my concerns and gave me things to work on at home.
So convenient and the staff is awesome!
Personalized and wonderful service!













"These people are amazing.  I have tried physical therapy about 4 times in the past and never went more than twice. I was looking for an overnight quick fix and in the past it just didn't seem to be working.  The rapour and laughs with Luke, David who has left due to another intern, Rick, Nicole, and the others are just amazing. They tease me about eating Popeyes on my graduation day lol.  I highly recommend these guys and all types of customers come in from young to grandparents. These guys had no idea I would do this but they deserve this awesome review and its the truth"
What a great facility! The staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  I've been there several times and they always help me.
"Very clean place, friendly staff and a great therapist.
A little hard to find but it is close to Pet Smart."
"After shoulder surgery I needed physical therapy to help get me back to my old self. Thankfully PT Solutions was closest to my home. Now that I know the level of service at this location I would have driven hours to get there!  I couldn't be happier with the level of expertise, courtesy, professionalism, and knowledge Laura, Steven, Kiara, and Natalie have provided. I am truly blessed to have found this PT Solutions in Canton GA.  My surgery was not easy or pain free..... But these great people made it so much better!  If you are in need of therapy for any reason, definitely call Natalie and make an appointment!"
"I could not recommend PT Solutions Canton enough! We have had a lovely experience at this location. They are professional. It is always clean. They are extremely knowledgeable. My daughter just completed her Therapy and we couldn't be more pleased. They went above and beyond to make a difficult experience for her, fun, innovative and highly productive to help her meet all of her goals within the limited insurance visits we had! We were so sad to attend our last session, but are excited to see what the future brings for her. Laura, Natalie, Cat, Holly and Steven are just wonderful people inside and out. They are friendly, warm, encouraging and so knowledgeable. We tell everyone about our experience with them and will highly recommend them to anyone that needs physical therapy!!"
I cannot recommend PT Solutions highly enough.  I was so impressed with the level of care I received I moved my 13yo to their location. What has impressed me the most is that they really take the time to continually tweak your treatment program to maximize your recovery.   My son has been treated by every therapist there at one time or another and I would not hesitate to recommend them all!
"I found this PT facility to be very customer friendly & professional!
The physical plant is very clean & designed for its mission.
I recommend PT Solutions based on my experience.

"The staff at the Canton PT Solutions, led by Laura Miller, is exceptional‚Äîprofessional, caring, knowledgeable, and friendly.  I would recommend them in a heart beat.  From the front desk to the assistants to the therapists, their attention to detail and willingness to provide an atmosphere that welcomes patients is exemplary. üëç"
Laura is a great physical therapist and has helped our family with a speedy recovery.
Laura Miller at PT Solutions and her team are amazing!  Having had physical therapy in the past they are tops in the field! They are very knowledgeable and caring!
I really like  this place. Not crowded and the staff is all friendly and helpful. I have gotten much stronger and my balance is much better since going.
"Truly gifted therapists!  I have had therapy after five surgeries, so I know therapy.  These folk are the real deal."
"This is the most amazing place for physical therapy! First off the location being off of Hwy 20 is convenient and its access to Hwy 20 or 140 is fantastic! The center, Canton Market place has plenty of parking and has plenty of great stores to shop either before or after your PT!

Your greeted by the always friendly and helpful Natalie! She will guide you through the registration and check in process in the most helpful and professional way! Natalie bis always so up beat and cheerful!

Then your therapist in my case Laura evaluates you and spends the time listening to your situation and then formulates your personal PT plan and goals! Laura is a godsend I never thought I would be able to be pain free and walk naturally again after my foot surgery. Laura will challenge you in her PT sessions and you will be shocked at the postive results if you listen to her! Laura is friendly and knowledgeable and if you trust her during your sessions you will be blown away at your results! I walk pain free and nautural again! I am back in a gym 5 days a week now thanks to Laura's experience and expertise in PT in resolving my foot situation ! Laura has an amazing healing gift!

And I also want to give a shout out to Steven who is also an amazing physical therapist in his own right! He's also professional, friendly and an amazing therapist!

The facility is a clean modern and pleasing to the eye environment!

I will never be ever say enough about this wonderful place for allowing me to walk and yes even run pain free!

I will always be in your debt! Keep up making people feel great!

Adam Nevis"
Really like Laura.  Very experienced and informative.  Easy to work with.  Staff is always very friendly.  Would recommend PT Solutions in Canton to my friends.
This place is great. They are very professional and listen to you.
Great service.  Very professional.  They know their stuff.
I am walking without a cane!!!!











Very friendly people very good bedside manner.
"The staff are very friendly. I went in with a broken leg, afraid to push myself. Matt helped me not only overcome fear but get back walking and back to work."

"Physical therapist Stephen Leo works consistently with each patient to ensure that their goal is achieved.  He develops a therapy program which works with the needs of each individual and then gives guidance throughout the session(s)....knowledgeable, caring, and understanding."
Stephen Leo was wonderful to work with. He gave great advice and was very knowledgeable with his exercises to strengthen my wrist. He was very detailed and thorough when providing me with my therapy regiment. I highly recommend the Milton Benchmark location.
Worked well for my rehab needs. Stephen was helpful and expedited my recovery. Would go back again and would recommend this specific location to anyone needing physical therapy.
Great and friendly staff! Very helpful with my injury recovery and getting me back on my feet. Highly-qualified staff and I highly recommend!
"Stephen Leo, DPT,  is awesome! I'm forever grateful for his help and will definitely return if needed in the future to Benchmark Physical Therapy in Milton, GA."
The entire staff is so friendly and professional. Stephen has been so great with my brother after he had an accident in his home. They truly care and go above and beyond. Highly recommend them.
Nicest staff right from Front Desk to therapist. My mother's treatment was flawless.
"After my accident, PT with Mr. Leo has helped my knee tremendously and we're working with my neck now! Thank you for all you do!"
Stephen did a wonderful job helping my son return to sports after a leg injury.  He was very detailed and kept us informed every step of the way.  Sarah was so  patient in helping to schedule appointments around my son‚Äôs busy school schedule.  I highly recommend this location for anyone needing PT!



I saw Dr. Luke for my low back pain I was experiencing for 8 months. I had tried other PT places and I did not see any improvement and was beginning to think it would never get better. I saw Luke for 3-4 weeks and noticed a huge improvement and I was able to be mostly pain-free and return to things   I enjoy. He was very knowledgeable and friendly and made PT fun for me. I actually enjoyed going! I cannot recommend him enough!
"If you are needing PT, this is the place to go. If you see Luke, I promise you won't hate going to PT. My boyfriend had a torn acl and meniscus, he saw Luke for a few months and within a few weeks he was walking normal again. He truly understands how to make you feel at home during your appointment and enjoy getting better."
Luke is a very caring and knowledgeable PT. He is an expert in treating sports related injuries and is passionate about helping all of this patients reach their goals.
PT Solutions is Amazing. I recommend Luke 100%!!!
Great care excellent staff I feel they did everything thing they could to help my condition to get me better I was highly satisfied an highly recommend them to help get u back to where u wanna be in ur physical recovery!!!
The services I received from Benchmark in Phenix City were top notch. Staff is very friendly and knowlegable. I would highly recommend Mark and benchmark to anyone that needs physical therapy.
Great therapists. Very friendly and knowledgeable.
Emily is amazing...
"Wonderful staff from the front desk to the therapists who work with me. Everyone is very friendly and very knowledgeable. Love coming here for my physical therapy and I leave wanting to continue my stretches at home. They motivate me so much that I can't wait for your next appointment. I'm very impressed with them. Can't thank the staff enough for making me feel stronger and better about myself. The therapists who work with me, make me feel like a friend than a client."
"Such a nice staff. Always clean and tidy. A very welcoming and positive environment. Really
enjoyed doing my therapy here. Thanks again to everyone at Benchmark for helping me and my mom recover."
"Great, caring staff. Easy location. Cater to all ages , and most all therapies. Highly recommend."
The staff at Benchmark was extremely  knowledgeable  and help me way beyond my expectations.
"I just can't say enough good things. This is a place I have gone into almost hysterically crying because it hurt my back so bad to drive there, and I left in relief. It seems almost everyone there really cares. They treat you like a good friend. They aren't nosey but yet so glad you have an upcomming doctors appointment or that you actually came in not crying for once and are feeling better. They are professional yet comfortable. The second I walked in and talked with Michael, he knew exactly what I needed. I know I am safe and in great hands. My recovery will be based about 80% because of him and I am forever in his debt. I highly recommend this facility to everyone."
"I‚Äôve been going to Benchmark for some time now.  I always get the absolute best service, they have friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere. Their expertise is one of a kind. Taylar, Aaron, Jen and Michael always give a üíØ percent. Liz & Jami always greet me with love and a smile and I‚Äôm one who really can appreciate that. Im glad I found Benchmark in Mcdonough. If u wanna get that body back working properly go to Benchmark Mcdonough."
"I am a cancer patient. Starting in late November, I began to get septis due to liver not draining. I also had extreme pain in my abdomen. I had already been prescribed fentnyl, percosett and trombonal. All strong opiiods. I had a pain block procedure the first of January, so they started taking me off the opiiods. Well my body didn't like that so I got sick and lost 20lbs very quickly. Mostly muscular. I needed help, bad. I could barely walk in to the McDonough Benchmark when I first met Michael. I started on the bike barely being able to turn it. Plus my BP was dropping with every turn. Now I am driving myself and doing level 2 on the bike with no BP issues. I'm doing much more with the help and encouragement of Michaels staff. I have 5 more weeks to go and I plan on being much stronger than when I went in. Thank you very much."
"On 23 June 2014, while on mission with ISAF Forces in Gardez, Afghanistan I was involved in an ""Insider Attack"" or ""Green on Blue"" attack.  I was shot three times from behind, by an Afghan Police Officers AK-47 rifle.  One round went through my right femur, one through my left back, exiting through my left abdomen and the last round went through my right forearm.

I spent over 67 days in the hospital, and to present date, I have undergone 14 major operations and over 30 various procedures.  I have a rod and associated hardware in my right femur. The exit wound blew out a large chunk of my Sartorius muscle, which had to be cut, and sewn down.  This also caused the need for a skin graft to patch an area a little larger than a grade A large egg.  By the grace of God, and unexplainable by my group of surgeons, the bullet that went through my abdomen missed all my internal organs- just nicking my colon.  My forearm was no big deal.

During the process healing, I developed three blood clots from a PICC line that was put in at the hospital at Landstuhl, Germany.  Both of my S.I. joints were fixated by two screws through my pelvis.  Unfortunately, the screw on my left side went in too deep and it struck a nerve in the persformius region of my buttock.  I would later have a dorsal spine stimulator implanted (As it's name implies, the paddles are placed two derma layers off of my spinal cord.). I also have carpel tunnel syndrome corrective surgery performed on both hands.

I believe I first saw Michael Dunning, at the Benchmark P.T. office located on Hudson Bridge Road, during the month of October 2014.  We joke now, but Michael was told that I had a ""knee"" injury, and they were curious if he could squeeze me in.  You can only imagine the look on his Michael's face, when he looks up and sees this guy, hanging on to a walker and struggling to take each step.  His eyes got even bigger once I get on the table, and begin to tell him my story.  Some knee injury, huh?  I would see Michael three times a week, for one and a half hour sessions.

I firmly believe that God not only saved my life in Afghanistan, but he also placed me in the care of Michael Dunning.  He is a Godly person, who has the patience of Job, an attentive ear and the touch of a healer.  I in no way wish to imply that my road of healing was an empty one.  But Michael Dunning has that rare ability to heal the ""whole body"", flesh and spirit.  He never ONCE pushed me harder than I had the ability to go, but was there at times to help me to a private room, as part of my PTSD I would cry my eyes out.  He and his staff have always shown exemplary dedication to the healing of others.

I just recently switched over to his new McDonougj office, as it is less crowded than the Hudson Bridge location.  Although it has been over two years since the date of my injuries, I still have a discomfort being in places that has a lot of people and activity.

Without a doubt, I would (and have) recommend Michael to anyone who is in need of physical therapy.  But remember- You only get out of what your willing to put in!

Thank you Michael and the entire Benchmark Physical Therapy team for picking me up off the floor a time or two!"

"This location is great! Everyone is friendly as well as patient with ALL individuals seeking therapy. While at this location I was provided with homework and other wonderful stretches that assisted with recovery and continue recovery and strengthening.

Enjoyed my time and my progress! Happy with my result and experience!

Thanks you all!!!"
"I had an amazing experience every single day I came into get my therapy. The staff is amazing, the environment is full of joy and happiness, and  the commitment of every single therapist is top tier! If therapy is needed again, without a doubt I would go no where else but Camp Creek Benchmark Orthopedics! Sad to leave, that‚Äôs how much I love the environment. Thank you to every single therapist for getting me to where I am today!"
"Benchmark Physical Therapy was absolutely amazing the staff was fantastic. It‚Äôs a very clean and comfortable environment. My Range of motion has improved as well as my strength and conditioning. This was a 10/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è experience. Highly recommend. Best in East Point / Atlanta. Want to give a special shout out to Amara, you keep doing great things. Traci, thanks you for all of your help. And to the rest of the Benchmark Family you‚Äôve all been amazing on my journey to recovery. üôèüèæ"
"Terrific service, always on schedule, no waiting. They keep you moving your entire time there with challenging exercises and gentle encouragement. So go in with the right attitude, ready to do the work, and get better. This team will fix you right up."
I would recommend this location to anyone.  The staff has superb customer service.  They make sure that all equipment is sanitized before you use.  And best of all they are sensitive to your needs.
"Entire staff is AMAZING. I worked with a few but over all Traci was the therapist I worked with the most. She‚Äôs hard core but caring because she wants you better. However, it doesn‚Äôt matter which therapist you work with they will push you to get better and motivate you. AWESOME team and beautiful personalities. They play great music while you work out, from old school to new age, music for everyone. Highly recommend this location if you need physical therapy. Thank you all!"
Excellent Physical Therapy facility. All of the therapists are absolutely wonderful and very professional. The front desk is always pleasant and professional as well.  I highly recommend Benchmark for any and all of your physical therapy needs.
The staff is very nice and attentive. I think it was very beneficial to make an appointment because the staff is very knowledgeable and they give you an individualized home exercise plan to take upon departure. Definitely would return if needed.
"I never thought I‚Äôd have an experience this pleasant while battling excruciating pain. The entire staff (front desk and therapists alike) at this location is AMAZING! They treat you like actual human beings, and they actually CARE. I haven‚Äôt had that experience very often in  healthcare settings. I would absolutely recommend this location. Traci was my therapist, and she‚Äôs amazing! She got me back in fighting/dancing shape....literally! I‚Äôm a martial artist and dancer, so the ability to move freely without pain is everything to me.  The other therapists are great as well. They work in concert, creating an environment that almost feels like family. I love that! I can‚Äôt praise them enough! I‚Äôm actually sad my treatment is over. Thank you all so much!!!!!"
Everyone at BenchMark in Camp Creek was very kind and helpful! They helped me recover and get back to normal activity which I‚Äôm certain I would not have achieved on my own. Such a great group of people and I would highly recommend these folks and will go back if I ever have physical therapy needs.
"All I can say is Awesome, Fantastic, Amazing. Benchmark at CampCreek was the best experience my daughter has had. Everyone was so amazing! Walking to an establishment and the attitude of everyone is posting, encouraging, and pleasant. I will tell so many of my experience.

Thank you Benchmark at Camp Creek"
"I just finished 12 sessions of physical therapy at Benchmark Camp Creek.  I must say the experience was truly beyond my expectations.  Traci was my therapist, and I must say I was impressed.  She‚Äôs very knowledgeable and keeps you in check to insure you are performing correctly and to the best of your ability.  They are very busy but you never feel forgotten.  All the staff.... the other therapist and receptionist are very friendly and courteous.  Going to physical therapy can be a taunting task.  I‚Äôm so glad I chose this location.  The atmosphere made for a very pleasant experience.  Love the music as well.  I would recommend anyone needing physical therapy not to consider going here, but definitely go!!  They are the best!  I sure will miss those massages."
"Very caring, friendly, professional and  individualized care. Highly recommend this facility."
The stuff here is so great . Very friendly environment. I reach my goals that I wanted to meet highly recommend coming here
"The wholistic experience was awesome. I worked with two therapists; however, I believe I would have received the same professional care from any of them. Not only were they friendly, they were knowledgeable and excited about getting us better. It is nothing like having such care in your neighborhood."
The staff is very friendly and kind. Everyone motivates you with  encouraging words. Traci is awesome and she did and outstanding job working with mw.
Had a good time! It was fun joking around with everyone. Friendly staff members. It was also fun solving their riddles!
This team took such great care of me!  When I first started coming to Benchmark I could barely stand on my crutches after my accident.  Now I‚Äôm healed and back at work like nothing happened due in large part to the treatment I received from the ladies at Benchmark Physical Therapy.  Would definitely recommend if you want a friendly helpful team to help you rehabilitate after your injury!!
AMAZING team they work so great together and they definitely get the job done!
"Hello I am Nyla and my experience was great , better then ever . The energy in the room is amazing , everyone is so nice and I love them so much"
I had an absolutely amazing experience at Benchmark. I have done physical therapy other places before but nothing compares to the work they do here. They had me doing real exercises and stretching to improve my strength and mobility. As an ex-gymnast the staff was able to adapt my program to conform to my specific needs and abilities. The entire staff has vibrant and comfortable personalities that made going to physical therapy feel like I was coming home. Going to benchmark would often be the highlight of my day. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
"I had a work related injury and was initially going to another place, so I was a little reluctant to try a new place but I'm so glad that I did. My PT was Jordan, but I also worked with the ""Singing Aaron"".  Ms. Jordan was exceptional, she always asked how I was feeling and if I had any concerns or questions. She explained the purpose for every exercise and she encouraged different pain relief methods, such as cupping, massage and needling (a form of acupuncture). If I ever have the need for physical therapy, this is definitely the place. Thank you, Jordan, Tracie, Aaron 1, Aaron 2, Sydney and Ms. Tanya!!!!"
"This practice is superb. Great staff and PT specialist. Dr. Tracy Jordan was my professional. I was there for about 12 weeks. She was respectful, engaging, would not allow me to whimper too much and was always able to show me how much I needed the work in my weak spots or injured area. Sometimes I'd come in confident that I was ready to close out and the training that day would be an eye opening about how much I still needed the work. It wasn't about trying to make more money off of me. It was about making me healthy and able to live my life without concern for my injured areas."
"Great Place to start your recovery from whatever that Pains you,And All The Ladies that work there are Phenomenal."
They were amazing through the entire journey.
"So sorry  that it took  so long.Shelby,thank  you for being patient with me..The  staff is great, no complaints.I Love you, guys ..Thank God, for placing Angels like  you in my  life
."
My experience at Benchmark PT Camp Creek was exceptional.  Courteous customer service personnel and highly  trained PT professionals are the hallmark of this company. Dr. Tracie Jordan provided a strategically targeted therapy that corrected my condition and positioned me for better mobility in my life. Many thanks to this caring staff.
"Awesome Experience! I had worked with Traci Jordan back in 2014, she was not the manager at the time. She provided skilled and knowledgeable techniques that helped make my torn tendon stronger. I was referred back to BenchMark again after falling down my stairs this year 2019. Traci is now the manager. Herr entire team was super courteous, professional, and knowledgeable. I was especially impressed how the team treated elderly patients. The all demonstrated care and compassion."
"I must say, I went in with some skeptics, But I came out a champ üèÜ, very professional group, with a lot of humor ü§£ü§£, I JUST WANT TO SAY THANKS.."
"I want to thank Traci Jordan and all of the wonderful staff at Benchmark Camp Creek! Everyone is always happy, welcoming and ready to assist wherever needed. As a client, you can tell that the staff genuinely like and care for each other. That positivity radiates into the atmosphere and helps with healing! This was my first experience with Physical Therapy and I enjoyed my experience. Thank you all for everything and helping me to get my life back together!"
Amazing staff. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Great team ! I thank each and everyone of you for getting me back to normal and fully recovered . 24 sessions after a partial torn acl . I am stronger and was able to return full duty back to work and should be able to hit the gym again ! Stay blessed
"WHEN I WAS ASSIGNED TO BENCHMARK PHYSICAL THERAPHY ,I WAS A BIT APPREHENSIVE...NOT BEING A FAN OF EXERCISE...,I STARTED NOT TO GO, BUT THEY CALLED ME TO SET UP THE EVALUATION APPOINTMENT...AT THAT APPOINTMENT OBSERVING HOW PROFESSIONAL AND YET EMPATHETIC THEY WERE FROM THE FRONT DESK TO THE MANAGER WON ME OVER...AT EVERY APPOINTMENT I WAS TREATED RESPECTFULLY AS WELL AS PROFESSIONALLY...THEY SANITIZE EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME AND ALWAYS GENTLY REMIND YOU TO KEEP YOUR MASK UP...HAVING BEEN TAUGHT AND INFORMED THE STRATEGY OF MY PT HAS ENCOURAGED ME TO EXERCISE AT HOME WHICH IS A MIRACLE IN IT SELF...,SO PLEASE THANK TRACI,AMBER,SHELBY,ZACH,SANTEANNA AND LaTANYA FOR THEIR OVER THE TOP SERVICE.I HAVE IMPROVED SO MUCH AND CAN NOW REACH MY HANDS ABOVE MY HEAD...BELIEVE ME THAT IS NO SMALL FEAT..BEFORE I COULD NOT EVEN DO MY OWN HAIR. THEY ARE A MARVELOUS TEAM! THANK YOU BENCHMARK FOR HIRING EACH OF THEM!!!!! GOD BLESS"
"Sooo I‚Äôm literally here every other day üòÇ. But fr tho, the staff is very friendly and happy to help their patients to get better. I enjoy coming here for physical rehabilitation. The environment is wonderful and upbeat!! Even the ladies at the desk are pretty cool. These people love their jobs! üòÇ"
I just love the energy of the staff.  They are wonderful and make u feel right at home. So if ur ever in need of physical therapy I would highly recommend them.
"They have the best staff. Their personnel is v
ery professional. They have the best atmosphere. They create a family environment. The entertainment is Disney+ but while there, they helped me to see lessons in each movie. I recommend this place to anyone involved in any work or auto related accidents. Great work benchmark!!!!!!"
"When I first arrived, my right shoulder was in a lot of pain. After weeks of therapy, thank you Tracie,  my shoulder is 100% better. I highly recommend BenchMark at Princeton Lakes. If ever I need physical therapy, I know where I'm going. The whole staff team is very good. I truly enjoyed my sessions even through the pain, lol. Good people to work with. Plenty of parking as well."
"This was a great experience for me. Having so much pain coming in on that first day, to almost none at all on my last day. I will recommend everyone to BenchMark  at Princeton Lakes. Staff was wonderful, special thanks to Aaron Weeks for doing a outstanding job with me."
"The staff at this location is AMAZING! I worked mostly with Brian, Ashlynn, and Briana while I frequented this location. At the Camp Creek location, they are professional, upbeat, and knowledgeable ALWAYS!!

As a new patient, I quickly adapted to their environment and immediately loved my time spent there. The staff is very welcoming from DAY1-final date; I throughly enjoyed my experience and would definitely recommend this PT facility to anyone. I will miss attending as they've made me feel as a part of their ""family"" in my short time there."
"Traci Jordan is my physical therapist, and she is a blessing that keeps on giving! I was in a car accident and I suffer from 5 herniated discs in my neck and lower back. Traci has treated me with compassion, dignity, and the very best care. She even gives me homework exercises to work on the days I don't see her, or on the weekends. I am a teacher and I work very far away, without Benchmark's flexible scheduling, I would not be able to receive the constant care that I need, without the worry that I would lose my physical therapist. I would recommend Traci Jordan and all the friendly and professional physical therapists and staff to anyone! They are a staff that you can trust!!!"
The staff at BenchMark is very professional and very kind.  I have been here several times for help and I wouldn't go any place else.  I always go away feeling better and satisfied that they have helped me reach my goal.  Thank you Aaron and BenchMark Staff!
Thank you to  Traci and Ashley (sp) for helping me to recover from my knee replacement surgery. The whole staff was friendly and professional from the minute you walked through the door.  I looked forward to my sessions because although the work was hard it was necessary in my recovery.  5 Star Service!
"Mr. Honeycutt was super fantastic with our mother. He was full of energy and life, he passed that same energy to my mother. I HIGHLY recommend Benchmark Camp Creek PT. Great Job Arron.

C. Baker"
"Best therapy place you can visit with good , helpful people. This was my first visit and its very nice with genuine people."
"My Doctor me to Benchmark for therapy, and love coming here staff treat clients as family with a smile it make it so easy for clients too forget why they are coming here. Staff at Benchmark is 100% effective in what they do. Thanks too you and your staff for helping me"
Aaron Honeycutt Sr. And Traci Jordan and their whole staff have been amazing to me I been coming here for two years and I love the atmosphere it‚Äôs like a family organization. There is never a dull moment at benchmark campcreek. The whole staff is caring and supportive of your healing process and getting you back on your feet where you need to be. Thanks for all you have done for me on my journey I love u all they will only let me give a 5 star rating but you all deserve 10 plus ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äòs
"The first time I entered, I was in pain and uncertain of the therapy experience, since I'd heard horror stories from friends about PT--""Patient Torture.""  Since that initial visit, I have been consistently pleased by the attentive care of the entire staff and high consciousness in this facility.  Sure, there is some kidding around occasionally, when therapists share humorous thoughts with the clients--and vice versa--but it is always good natured.  I am certain all clients experience some pain or discomfort during their exercises, but we are skillfully encouraged to do our best, in caring ways.  From the greeting you'll hear when the open the door, thru your appointment and scheduling for the next visit, the employees at this site have got you covered. Even the choice of background music is well modulated and sensible.  Whenever it gets really busy and looks like there's too much going on for a therapist to pay you the attention you require, that's only momentary.  Wait times are minimal, as therapists work with clients with ease and grace and expertise.  This is a well-run facility with a good vibe, highly recommended."
"Very pleasant experience at BenchMark
All therapist that I had the privilege to work with were AWESOME
Aaron who originally evaluated me as well as did further treatment, Tracii,Lori Brian and Ashley were EXCEPTIONAL . Front office receptionist started the atmosphere with welcoming me with a professional smile and greeting.I applaud all persons involved in my care and thank them for helping to bring me to full recovery.I recommend Benchmark at campcreek!!!May God always bless each of you as you bless others !!!"
I love this place and the staff. Just wonderful people and very dedicated to their job. They took good care of my mom. Mr. Aaron Honeycutt! You are Amazing THANK YOU for being my moms PT . Much Appreciation for Benchmark at Campcreek&Staff
"Awesome staff. Have seen 3 different therapists due to my schedule and they have all been very caring and knowledgeable and make therapy fun to come to, even though it hurts."
"Alexa helped my mom tremendously. My mom was barely walking before the therapy sessions, now my mom gained her mobility and is walking upright. Alexa managed to make my mom engaged and comfortable.  The whole team is awesome, they treat you like family. Thanks guys!!!"
Aaron is the best and can‚Äôt forget about my girl Courtney always courteous friendly and polite I‚Äôll miss them sincerely mr cook lol
"This place is absolutely the best!!!! All the workers are nice, assertive to your needs and work diligently to get u healthy. They work you, but it feels like a FAMILY you have fun and then it's OVER!!!!"
"I have been attending Benchmark Physical Therapy, on Princeton Lakes Way, since the beginning of July 2019. My therapist Kristeen Urena, has been doing a wonderful job on my Rotator Cuff tear. She is very professional, caring, very knowledgeable during this difficult healing process of mine. She always explains everything in detail of what she is doing, and what you should expect from the therapy, that she is giving you. I definitely would recommend this location & the therapist to anyone."
Thanks to my PT Mr Aaron for all he did to help me through my therapy I really appreciate him and the rest of the staff there very nice people.
"Awesome environment, good energy and great people to work wit!! Definitely the place to be if you want to recover from any injury!!"
I have received great results since the first week of PT from Dr. Traci Jordan.
"OMG where do I start. Benchmark PT was an amazing experience from start to Finish. From the Office  Coordinator, Ms. LaTonya to the Quality and professional services rendered to my 16 year old son by both Dr. Aaron Honeycutt and Dr. Traci Jordan. My son underwent rehabilitation services after injuries incurred jumping hurdles at his  High School. Not only did he return to his varsity team in top rate condition but he is now Inspired to become a Doctor of Physical Therapy. Himself, a field he knew nothing about previously, Thank You Benchmark TEAM!!!"
"I found out about BenchMark therapy from my Doctor. I went through shoulder therapy for 3 months with BenchMark Physical Therapy and my condition has not improved at all. If anything I feel my condition has worsened. Apart from it being a waste of time and money, the pain I continue to endure is the worst.

During my therapy and acupuncture sessions I felt like the doctor did not care or pay attention to my needs. Even after explaining where the pain was and the cause, the doctor continued to have me practice the same painful exercises that showed no results. I do not recommend this clinic to anyone and hope the re-evaluate themselves.

Sincerely,
J. Rodriguez"
"I injured my knee at work and have been coming to benchmark for physical therapy the past couple of months. Everyone is so nice and treats you like family. I absolutely love Traci because she does what needs to be done to make sure im back to normal, and gives me the extra push I need when Im being lazy and just dont want to do it lol.

Some days I felt discouraged like I was never going to be back to normal but shes always so reassuring and actually listens to me and my concerns; she takes the steps necessary so that im not in pain but always progressing. Thanks Benchmark!"
Great place and everyone is so helpful I definitely recommend them
It took me some time but I am getting better Erin is hard but the end result is wonderful :) :)
I loved this place. I gave them a hard time bc I thought physical therapy was supposed to be easy but they actually make you do the physical part! Lol and it's no joke!  I had herniated discs and was in serious pain constantly. After the first two weeks on consistent therapy I started to notice increased mobility & a significant reduction in pain - even though my muscles were sore my back & core were getting stronger. If I get into another accident I know where to go! Don't waste your time at one of those places that does the same stem & heat for everyone then charges you $700 per visit and never treats your issue.
Great facility and excellent  staff.
Although it can be busy the therapist take their time and help you on recover. I have been going for almost a year and they have helped stabilize my injuries.
Absolutely GREAT!!!!!  üëçüèΩ
Made a lot of progress here.











"I am so happy that I went to BenchMark for my Physical Therapy as I received excellent health care and a quick recovery. I enjoyed the safe environment, everything sanitized as quickly as it was used and friendly personnel. The therapists are very knowledgeable, easy to understand the therapy methods they have you doing and give constant encouragement. I actually looked forward to each visit which has not been the case in previous years at other facilities. BenchMark is the place to go for quick recovery and excellent health care!"
"I never thought that therapy  could be so great. I had been to another place for therapy and was disgusted with the people and the results I got. Let me tell you about the Benchmark Physical Therapy: They are the greatest team that I have ever seen. My arm is like a new one after their Therapy.  Sincerely, if you want to heal from your injury, then go to Benchmark.  I  üíòthem and their performance. Greatest!!!!!!"
"Benchmark had been outstanding. Monika is an incredible PT and I just couldn‚Äôt believe the value I got out of these appointments. I would highly recommend her and this office to anyone dealing with injury or surgery recovery.

For reference; I was dealing with a subscap tear, biceps and rotator cuff inflammation as a result of a sports injury."
"Had a good experience. Only complaint I have is when I was put with ones that did not do dry needling. It helped me and 3 times was put with one that could not do it. Train them all in all things if you are going to move a person from one to another. At Athens, TN Kristopher Baker is the best in my opinion. Jessica Walker right behind him."
"The main therapist at this place is well known and all of their co-workers who occasionally help are very kind. Very friendly and I've been going here for about 8 months because of knee surgery. They do their very best to give equal care to all patients. It's not the location that gets 5 stars, it's the Staff!"
"I love this place! My mother came here the next day after her surgery and everyone here welcomed her. Monika, Will, and Kenyatta are the best. I definitely recommend BenchMark PT to anyone who is in need of PT!"
Great therapist who really care for your overall health! They truly helped me a lot.
Great staff! They will treat you like family. Came in for a fractured ankle while in a walking boot and was able to make a full recovery.
Great experience and very knowledgeable staff. Would recommend to my family and friends.
"They are professional, competent, and thorough throughout the entire process, while maintaining a caring, personal, and individualized atmosphere for everyone. My PT exercises we developed specifically to target my areas of concern, modifications made for my physical limitations, and increasing challenges implemented to encourage and ensure maximum improvement. I have had PT approximately 10 times throughout my 6+ decades of life, and Benchmark of Athens, is by far the best experience and results I‚Äôve yet to have."
Staff is amazing and their work is even better.
I love this place!! They‚Äôre so nice and professional. Really have a good concept of the problem they‚Äôre treating as a whole and each session directly works toward that! And Taylor at the front desk is GREAT!!!
"Extremely professional,  polite, and go above and beyond to help patients. Very happy I chose to come in and get help with my back pain. Looking forward to continuing my pt with them."
"Benchmark PT has been a special place. One of my best friends has been working for the company and the joy he has is admirable. I have not been there myself, however, I have heard nothing but great things from everyone that has been associated with Benchmark. Keep up the good work!"
I was a patient of Monika Thelen and Alex Adams. They are both super sweet and would do everything in their power to make sure i reached my full potential. The atmosphere in the clinic is what makes it worth it. The previous full time tech made my experience very well worth. I miss her. Stevan‚Äôs dad jokes makes it a fun experience. I give this clinic 5 stars.
The sweetest people work at this place. Monica is awesome!!They are professional always understanding to your needs and concerns!! I 100% recommended this place!!
Benchmark really helped me to get back on track after a car wreck the Therapy really made a difference
Since my car accident ive been having complications with my back neck and legs but benchmark has been amazing not only do they know what their doing but their hospitality from the time you enter the door is so fascinating. They all are so inviting and so professional that omce you go you never want to leave.. I love benchmark
Looks like I've find the right place

















"Corey Green is great......
He's killing me but I know it's my fault for letting myself get this way .he's just doing his job and great at it..."
My experience has been  very good ! Thank u Corey for challenging me and for being so kind!!
"The experience I‚Äôve had with Lori Peacocks has been far beyond value. She‚Äôs eased pains that I‚Äôve had from multiple military surgeries that I was told to just live with! She didn‚Äôt just rehabilitate my knee, she rehabilitated my life. I never want to see anyone else!!!!"




PT Solutions of Morningside I recommend to anyone looking forward to getting past their pain or anything dealing with their fitness. My first initial visit was warm and welcoming. I admit I was apprehensive but those feelings were quickly replaced because of the personable attention and knowledge shared by the staff. I left feeling great üëçüèæ
"I never expected to enjoy going to physical therapy, but the staff at the PT Solutions Morningside clinic made it such a pleasant experience. It was always nice to see their smiling faces, and my therapist, Katrina, was absolutely amazing. She is super knowledgeable and caring, and she worked diligently with me until I was pain free. It doesn‚Äôt get any better than this!"
My surgeon recommended PT Solutions after I had a bad experience at another PT office. And I was not disappointed. Katrina was an awesome PT! She was very thorough in identifying other muscles that were tight or not firing that were affecting the recovery of my knee. I highly recommend going to this location & requesting Katrina!
"Katrina was a key part to my shoulder recovery and I am very grateful for all that she has done to help me through my healing process. I had a pretty rough shoulder injury and some nerve complications after surgery which was expected to delay my healing. Not only did Katrina help me rehab my shoulder on schedule with my surgeon's expectations, she also helped me manage my nerve issues so that it didn't hold me back from recovering my shoulder. I think it is very important to have a hands-on therapist that is open to educating the patient and that is exactly what Katrina did for me. 10/10 would recommend, you just have to go in with the willingness to work hard toward your recovery and the staff at PT solutions will get you on the right track."
"Both Katrina and Tony are amazing. They truly listen and design your therapy for you. They are professional, personable and make you feel very comfortable.
I have trouble engaging certain muscles and they take the time to talk me through how to engage them.
I would recommend them to anyone. Best PT‚Äôs ever."
I have had a great experience at PT Solutions on Amsterdam.   I really look forward to my sessions with Katrina.  My neck and shoulders are doing much better since I've started physical therapy.
"The therapists here are fantastic. The billing department, however, is HORRENDOUS. I would never have gone here had I known I'd be dealing with a DEBT COLLECTION AGENCY 7 months after I stopped going here. I paid all of my bills yet they keep sending me statements. I have called them 10 times and each time they say I owe nothing and to ignore the statement, but now I have a debt collector after me? Good luck if you choose to go here..."
I have been raving about this physical therapy practice.  The location is easy to access and the atmosphere in the clinic is positive.  I have been working with Tony following a patella dislocation and have been very impressed with his clinical skill set.  I highly recommend going with PT Solutions.
"The therapists are great. I went to a location in Florida. The bill at the end of 12 visits was outrageous though. $5,470 for 12 visits. Auto insurance was supposed to pay but they didn't (long story). So I got the bill and they said there was no way to reduce it to a reasonable amount since my insurance was supposed to pay in the first place. They are over billing the allowable amounts per unit of therapy. I know that the insurance company will not pay the entire amount, but they expect me to. That's BS. I'm disappointed in the company. Now I have to get an attorney involved to keep them ethical."
"Absolutely love PT Solutions Morningside. I‚Äôve never done PT before and not personally knowing a PT, was a bit scared after having surgery on my achilles, and trust a stranger with a serious injury/recovery. Katrina and staff have not only helped me significantly progress in strength and flexibility but also my confidence to get back to normal. Highly recommend them!"
"The clinical staff is exceptional, and my experience with the physios was consistently excellent. However, the billing department is without exception the very worst I have dealt with. For that reason, I would not recommend PT Solutions to anyone under any circumstance."
"John Michael is a fantastic PT.  I am an avid runner, hurt my knee, and was very upset. John Michael and staff took great care of me.  I am forever grateful.  BIG THANK YOU to Morningside PT Solutions!"
PT Solutions is AMAZING. I've never worked with a more friendly staff or have people that serious care about getting you feeling better and pain free!
Super kind and knowledgeable staff willing to work with my schedule and income.  I have shown consistent healing in my injury with their guidance and would recommend them to anyone.
They've been great!
"The billing here is atrocious. Sent me to collections, yet I confirmed on multiple occasions I had no balance."
Great service!!
Very Good!













This was an excellent experience as my therapist helped me to improve through good exercises and I am again takin my morning walks.
"This location is amazing,  you will not be disappointed.  I strongly recommend Benchmark Brasleton.  The entire staffs are wonderful to work with.  They always greeted you with such warm welcome good morning or good afternoon.  Brooke is incredibly awesome and I'm delighted to work with her.  I gave them 100% ."
"The sweetest and most fun people to work with. Thank you to Melissa, Junior, Jessica, and everyone else who helped get me back on my feet. Never been so sad to leave therapy :‚Äô)"
"Brook and the team are a pleasure to work with. I actually look forward to my appointments. After having wrist surgery, I needed all the help I could get. Making great progress. The front desk is always welcoming and very helpful."
"Brooke Smith, Mary, Courtney and Halley have been very professional and pleasing to work with. I have nothing but good things to say about them. They know just how the hand works and how to help mine heal."
"My experience going to Bench Mark for physical therapy was awesome, everyone was great to work with."
"Never had acupuncture done, but went to try It because my friend recommended It. I suffer with super bad migraines and she told me the needling here was good and she was NOT wrong. I went to Jessica and let me say she‚Äôs just so awesome :)"
"Absolutely fantastic group of therapists. Very knowledgeable, caring and experienced. You can‚Äôt go wrong going here"
I really enjoyed my therapy sessions here at BenchMark. Everyone was nice and welcoming. Stephanie is so kind and fun to work with. She is very knowledgeable and I definitely recommend!
The entire staff is amazing. They are truly interested and helping you. The atmosphere is uplifting and happy. I highly recommend them.
"This place is amazing.   As a nurse practitioner I have seen many physical therapist in action.  The providers here are top notch.  Not only are they good at their job but they communicate well, educate patients and genuinely care about everyone who walks in the door.     I have seen the amazing work that PT does not only for my patients but my family.  If it wasn't for this location both of my parents may not be walking and living life to the fullest.  Thank you Benchmark for giving my kids and myself lasting memories."
"Since my therapy sessions began with Adam, I have been extremely impressed with his concern for me and his attention to detail with my rehabilitation.  He motivated and encouraged me to work hard, remain patient, and determined to succeed.  When I arrived for my sessions, I was always acknowledged by all Staff members by name.  They too were involved in my therapy and encouraged me to stay with it to succeed.  They all made a very positive impression on me. If it wasn‚Äôt for Benchmark, I wouldn‚Äôt have progressed as I have and be where I am at today.  I now feel a part of the Benchmark family.

Tom Dibble"
"I have been a patient twice since the beginning of the year, once for OT and once for PT.  All the therapists and the support staff I have interacted with have been superior.  There is a true team spirit that permeates the entire facility.  The therapists are knowledgeable and skilled.  They challenged me to go beyond what I thought I could do.  At the same time they were compassionate and caring.  The ladies in the office are efficient and so cheerful and personalable that I look forward to each visit.  I highly recommend this facility."
"Professional, considerate, effective. Everyone here is greeted by name and made to feel welcome. Facility is spacious and always kept clean. The therapists, techs and office staff all excel and feel like a family. Michael actually won an award for tech of the year! You are in good hands. Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough!"
"I am a high school student that has been interning at this location since June of 2018. The people employed there are kind, hardworking individuals that provide superb patient care. It is amazing being able to see patients gain strength and mobility as weeks go by of therapy. The relationships formed between the patients and the professionals is remarkable and I am happy to be apart of it. They inspire me everyday to reach excellence in my pursuit to become an occupational therapist."
"Have had therapy there several times and had great results! Stephanie for hand occupational therapy, Kyle and Jessica for physical therapy. I would recommend the other therapists there as well, they do work as a team and are well aware of how you are doing and your progress! Jennica, Adam and Michael all very good!
Thank you!"
"Words can‚Äôt describe how wonderful this Benchmark is in Hoschton . If you need physical therapy this is the place to be. From the receptionist up front to all the therapist, they make you feel welcome and they have become family to us. I had about 3 months of therapy. They knew what to do to make my shoulder stronger . They celebrated milestones with me. Everyone greets you by name and ask how you are .
The experience was so amazing. Special thanks to Michael H for being with us every step of this journey. Thanks to Adam and Michael for all they did. I was so blessed to be sent to this Benchmark. It‚Äôs hard enough when you are in pain from surgery but to have the entire staff take care of you . It‚Äôs just amazing ."
"So appreciative of the support and rehabilitative therapy given to me after a break and surgery on my wrist. I am almost back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù thanks to Stephanie and her magic!!!!  Thank you!
Also, the climate at this center is amazing. When I walk in, I feel like all the therapists care about me and consider me a friend (especially Jennica)!!!"
"Benchmark of Braselton is an outstanding facility. Every appointment is tailored to your specific need in your physical therapy recovery. The staff is polite, friendly, encouraging, and they believe in helping others in their physical recoveries. Highly recommended! This location is leaps and bounds better than any other PT location I‚Äôve been to throughout the years."
I love this facility! Everyone here is very friend and personal. They work hard to get you where to you need to be and to achieve your goals. I Have done physical therapy at other facilities before but none of them were as personal and caring as benchmark!
I‚Äôve been going to Benchmark in Braselton for a couple of months now and have found them to be very professional and caring in my healing process.  Kudos to Adam and Michael(s) for their guidance and oversight in putting me through my paces and helping me mend.  They‚Äôve been great!
"The staff was excellent. From the tech to the therapist I felt taken care of and knew I was in good hands from the beginning. The facility was clean, comfortable and organized. Thank you Benchmark for your hard work and educated help."
The Benchmark team is a great family to be around! Everyone is greeted with a wonderful welcome and treated with special care from each therapist they work with. I recommend this location and the therapists there for any and all therapy needs.
"Absolutely the BEST - always immaculate, warm and friendly atmosphere, staff is always welcoming. They are wonderful in explaining exercises and anatomy. ALL of the therapists and techs are fantastic - my therapist is Jessica, and she's a miracle worker. And Michael the tech is a cutie! üòù"
"This benchmark location is the best!!! Such a great staff of well educated and caring people!
This group works hard to help you recover safely and quickly.  Always a very comfortable and encouraging atmosphere!!!! I highly recommend them!"
"I have visited  Benchmark Braselton for several issues.  The first thing I could say.  It is filled with Joy!  So no matter the struggle I‚Äôm facing, the spirit of the center makes it better.  They truly exemplify a team spirit!  Everyone works together and supports all patients.  And the therapy WORKS!"
"Place is great. Went here to rehab my knee, they had me back to full strength in no time. Really comfortable chairs in the waiting room. 10/10 would recommend."
"Excellent service from Stephanie and Donna.  They created a custom removable cast for me that gave me much more mobility than the other option of a full, more permanent cast.  I can even wash the cast in the washing machine!  Highly recommended!"
The Benchmark team is a great family to be around! Everyone is greeted with a wonderful welcome and treated with special care from each therapist they work with. I recommend this location and the therapists there for any and all therapy needs.
"I‚Äôve been going to here for quite some time now for therapy for my back surgery and recovery. Everyone at this facility has been super nice and is always more than willing to help in anyway they can. I can‚Äôt wait to get to 100%, but thank you so much for getting me as far as I am thus far."
"Benchmark in Braselton has a wonderful staff for whom I am so thankful to have been provided physical therapy for my total knee replacement!  I have had to have physical therapy for several other surgical procedures throughout the years; however, none have excelled in their abilities, attention to my specific needs, and their overall friendliness while receiving my therapy as have everyone at Benchmark!  Specifically, I have ""enjoyed"" having both Michael(s) working with me, primarily; however, I have also received therapy from others should they be providing therapy to another person.  The other therapist(s) was/were able to pick up right where Michael left off!  I never had to wait for therapy!  I am so impressed with all of whom I have had contact while receiving therapy.  I have been greeted by name and a big smile, not only by one, but all the staff that I met on a daily basis.  They are very well trained professionals who go the extra mile to ensure that my needs are met.  I have progressed so much in such a short time; more than I ever thought possible!  I am really looking forward to my total recovery with my brand new knee!  All this is possible due to my surgeon and the wonderful staff at Benchmark who have provided me with the best therapy ever for my recovery.   I not only think of them as great therapists, but also new friends!!  Thank you so much!

"Everyone is very nice and welcoming- recognizing each patient by name. The facility is spacious, organized, & clean. They always accommodate my schedule and are encouraging."
Benchmark guided my disabled fathers therapy very well. The physical therapists helped give him his range of motion back so he could play with his pet cat and be happy again. Love this place!
"There is no way that I could have recovered completely without the help of Stephanie at Benchmark Braselton. Physical therapy is so important not only for healing, but also for encouragement and support mentally. Injuries can be very daunting, but Stephanie was wonderful at helping me navigate to complete recovery. Her years of experience and knowledge made me feel comfortable at a very scary time. I can never thank her and Benchmark enough!  I wish there were more than 5 stars!!"
"How fortunate to have such a great physical therapy office within 10 minutes of home.  During the past 4 years, at various times,  I have received excellent care from the therapists and techs, as well as being cheerfully greeted by the office receptionists at each appointment.  The atmosphere is very friendly, and now since the facility has been enlarged, very comfortable and spacious.  It is like a social hour with friends who are there to help you re-gain strength and wellness as you enjoy (?) the often  strenuous exercises and therapy.   Great job Benchmark/Hoschton-Braselton!  And Thank You !"
"Not only is this the best Physical Therapy treatment I've ever had, it is the best Healthcare I've experienced. Starting with booking my first appointment and dealing health insurance, the office manager was completely on top of her game. They were able to get the pre-authorizations in advance, collected and organized everything from the doctor so that my first visit was productive and focused on recovery rather than paperwork.  The entire Physical Therapy team works together as one unit almost like a family. They know exactly where I am in my recovery, what my program should be, sensitivity to pain and discomfort and what the doctor has outlined for me in the future.  I would use these words to describe the staff:  competent professional compassionate organized attentive empathetic encouraging friendly and unfortunately some of them are Bulldog and Alabama fans,  which makes them human and that's what we really want."
Used this place for several months because of re-injuries. All the therapists are well trained and very professional. Jessica was awesome helping me figure out the root cause of my foot injuries and treating them. Highly recommend this location!
"Always excellent treatment plan, thorough workout and exercises. And they have the great option of dry needling. Staff very pleasant, and focused on you."
I cant say enough about this amazing group of people who happen to be physical therapists! The way they care for people is over the top as well as the relaxed atmosphere at this location.  I would recommend Jennica and the rest of the group to everyone!
Great experience.  Stephanie and Donna were wonderful to work with when I broke my wrist. They are very knowledgeable and supportive.
"I moved to this area from another state. Finding the right Physician Therapist is like finding the right Cardiologist. You have to believe he/she are the best of the best.  On the cutting edge, feel like you‚Äôre their only patient. They listen to what I have to say and respect it.  Respect goes both ways, I listen to their advice/plans and trust it. After trying many PT offices in the area I finally found Benchmark in Hoschton, GA.  I‚Äôve been treated for both PT and Occupational Therapy.  They have been able to rehabilitate my shoulder after a difficult Rotator Cuff surgery, build my core so my lower back is able to play golf again and are currently working on getting feeling back in two fingers that I thought would never have feeling again. PS - I never have to wait and it‚Äôs easy to get an appointment that fits my schedule. So yes, I would recommend this office to anyone who asks."
The therapists at Braselton Benchmark are professional and compassionate. They all take the time to ensure that you are doing exercises correctly for maximum benefit. I highly recommend
This session of hand therapy has been a great experience.  The therapists are wonderful and genuinely care about the patients.  Would highly recommend them to anyone
"Benchmark in Hoschton has been tremendous.  Adam, Jennica, and Michael have all been great.  The progress I have made with their guidance and support has been tremendous, and I couldn't be more pleased."
This is by far the best physical therapy clinic I have been to. I have a history of bilateral ACL surgeries as well as foot and shoulder issues and Jessica has been great at getting these injuries under control! Highly recommend going here!
I have been a patient there several times for different diagnosis and have always found the staff to be wonderful. I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else. I highly recommend this clinic.
Jennica was such a help! She made my knee feel like new again. The staff there is so friendly and knowledgable. I will definitely be back for my next injury.
"I have been a patient at Benchmark in Braselton for  3 or 4  different conditions (hey, who's counting??).  From the front office to the techs, they are a great group of people.   I have been treated by several different staff members .  Every one is courteous and knowledgeable.   They are wonderful at making you feel comfortable, and helping you through the rough spots.  I guess one of their finest attributes is their empathy.  Not many health professionals can boast of that !  I will continue to go back to Benchmark Braselton as the need arises."
Very impressed by this staff! They are dedicated to give you a wonderful experience. Would definitely recommend this clinic.
"Two separate medical events lead me to Benchmark Physical Therapy. First medical event, I was blessed to be placed with Jennica Pridemore as my PT. The second medical event, I was able to request Jennica as my PT.  I am grateful for the time, continued encouragement, and total concept healing this ENTIRE staff represents. I could not imagine going to a different PT location when the staff at 5415 Thompson Mill Rd is available."
"Great team of PT‚Äôs and support staff. Very laid back and friendly while also professional. With such a long recovery for a ruptured Achilles, it has become a home away from home. They have unlimited supply of coffee as well! Thanks Benchmark of Braselton...you‚Äôre the best!!!"
They are amazing!! I highly recommend going to Benchmark in flowery branch to meet all your needs! Jennica Pridemore is great and super helpful!
"This Benchmark is a very clean and professional business. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. You are greeted by friendly faces and the techs are very helpful especially Michael, he is there for everything you need and always willing to help. All of the PT's and PTA's are wonderful and hard working to get you back on your feet and feeling great!"
I just want to thank all of you for the wonderful treatment my wife Susie has had for Rotator Cuff Surgery and Achilles Tendinitis. Jennica has been awesome for Susie!
"I hated the thought of having to go to therapy, until I went here.  The staff is unbelievable. They make you feel like part of the family. They really go the extra mile. I'm going to miss the whole staff when I'm finished!!!!"
"This place has a wonderful environment, sweet atmosphere and wonderful people! Best benchmark  location! You don‚Äôt find a place like this one!!"
"Jennica is a wonderful, caring and informative therapist. The facility and staff are amazing. I have and will continue to recommend the Braselton location."
Benchmark in Braselton has been great to me during my rehab. Stephanie has brought my left hand back to life with her knowledge and dedication to occupational therapy.
"Staff is very friendly, hardworking and courteous. I would definitely recommend to friends and family. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
"It was a pleasure to come here to receive therapy, everyone was so kind and friendly. They did such a great job I had to cook them a pasta lunch. Would definitely recommend them to friends and family."
"Knee replacement huge success thanks to the encouragement, patience and experience here!!! Staff is awesome! If needed in the future no other choice for me"
"I have seen several therapists at Benchmark, they are all wonderful and patient, so are the receptionists.  They treat you like family and take the time to listen.  Very knowledgeable when asked questions yet can make you laugh even if you are in pain."
Staff at Braselton Benchmark are all very attentive and knowledgeable. The location is easy to get to and is well equipped. It is kept very clean and the patients are well cared for.
"I've been to Benchmark for a couple different injuries and they were always friendly amd attentive to each client. Although therapy can be tough, they find ways to make it fun and cater to each individual's needs and goals. I couldn't recommend the staff here enough."

"I wanted to take some time, and tell you how wonderful this location is. Staff is very nice, clean, and professional. You walk in the door and everyone has a smile on their face. The PT ive been seeing for some time is Dr. Dunton. He is very professional and supportive in my rehabilitation. He is very gentle and his hands are supple, he really knows how to adjust me. His Jim Carey's The Grinch like body type, hair and all is very welcoming. Thank you for all your support Dr.Dykweed."
Great staff.  Very professional and upbeat.  Making great progress after a car wreck.
Relaxed atmosphere.  Therapists identify and treat the issue I've had with lower back for many years.  Through progressive strength training of targeted muscle groups the pain is diminished/gone.
Wonderful experience! I highly recommend this location for your physical therapy needs.
The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I feel very comfortable every time I walk in.

Awesome staff and facility!  I highly recommend anyone looking for therapy to check them out!

Best physical therapy place around. Great staff who are passionate about their work.
"The staff is very professional, knowledable, and most of all very caring about their patients and what is needed for them (patients) to get them back where they need to be health wise!"
"Wanna give a HUGE shoutout to Jessica Haynie! She will work with you until you get better, and I promise, you listen to what she says, you will see improvements. After my ACL surgery, I followed Jessica's instructions to the point. I am 2 weeks post-op, walking with no pain, full extension. I am getting ready to do elbow surgery soon. You can bet that after surgery, I will want Jessica to work on the elbow as well. Thank you for the help!!"

"I am a Physician and have been coming to Benchmark in Hoschton for three years for various sports injuries and a broken shoulder and ruptured rotator cuff.
I have worked with many PT facilities over the years and this is without a doubt the best facility I have experienced.
My tech, Michael Hagan, is beyond excellent.  He is so knowledgeable and has such perfect technique that if I do what he shows me, the only outcome is getting better!  When I am coming in the mornings, he also makes sure I have coffee waiting  and that is one of the things that makes customer service stand out at this wonderful facility.

My Therapists, Megan Fusco and Jennica Pridemore are so skilled that they have taken a horrible shoulder injury that was not a surgical candidate and have brought me back to 90% and am even gently starting to follow their golfing protocol.

The entire staff is friendly, extremely respectful and clearly have a huge heart for their patients who so need their incredible expertise.

I have referred several friends to my friends here and no one has been anything but glowing in their reviews.

I am so grateful that the Lord lead me to this group of healing, kind hearted group of professionals.  I would never consider going to any other facility.

Exceptional!

Deborah L Carter MD"
Great clinic with a great staff! PT's all work well together to accomplish patient's goals and supporting staff is helpful in any way they can assist the PTs.

"Nice open floor plan, extremely positive therapist, great attention to cleanliness would recommend 10/10"
"Very friendly, and helpful! Would definitely go back."
Fast friendly and effective. Early and late hours. They really cater to their clientele.

"Great Clinic, top of the line equipment, and the best PT‚Äôs you can find."
"Super clean facility, extremely knowledgeable doctors, techs and staff. Anyone that has been here is sure to tell that this clinic aims to improve patients health and overall wellbeing"

I always say BENCHMARK BRASELTON!!"
Awesome!
The OC's are awesome at this location.....they are very helpful
"10/10 recommend this location!! Great people, great service!"
The people at Benchmark Braselton are so caring.  Bree is a sweetheart.
"I had a bicycle accident and messed up my shoulder really bad.  I had surgery to repair the damage four days later.  I went to Benchmark PT in Braselton for two reasons, (1) I had exercised with Robert in the past (2) Megan had worked on my knee and did a great job.  So I chose to go back to Megan for my shoulder rehab.  Little did I know that each and every therapist, technician and front desk employee seemed to support each other and sincerely wanted to help me as a patient.  Michael and Michael, technicians at the time, were awesome.  They took time to go over in depth the proper techniques of each exercise, even doing them with me at times.  They were very friendly with a sincere desire to get me back in service as soon as possible.  I requested Megan as my therapist and she began treating my surgical site with the same precise treatment I had from her several years ago.  Thanks Megan for getting me started on the road to quick recovery.  Megan decided to wind down and began working an abbreviated schedule which made it necessary to ‚Äúpawn‚Äù me off to Jeneca.  To my surprise, although their therapy styles were different, the healing process continued at a fast pace.  I owe the quick healing not only to my amazing surgeon, but to the several months spent with Jeneca and Michael H. working to get my shoulder and arm strength back to functioning in almost normal fashion.  I appreciate when Adam took over for a few visits when Jeneca was out.  He did a great job.  To say the least, except for the injury and surgery, this was an amazing experience and I can‚Äôt thank Megan, Jeneca, Michael, Michael, Adam and the rest of the crew for their support, professionalism, expertise and just plain good and friendly nature.  I have come to care for each of you very much.  Thanks can‚Äôt begin to let you know how I feel!"
"Very professional staff, clean environment. Loved working with Jessica during my time there!"
They're great and very thorough in their treatment.

Matt and Sierra were so wonderful!! They made the environment so fun and welcoming! Matt is a great guy and wonderful therapist! Thank yall so much! If anyone in my life ever needs pt I will 100% send them to Benchmark Watkinsville!
"I was very pleased with the quality of care I received at benchmark Watkinsville. Mark and Payton who worked with me were extremely professional, skilled, friendly, and easy to work with."
"Words can‚Äôt explain how great this place is, not just the place but the people that works here you can really tell they love what they do and Matt provide excellent care for his patient, I would recommend my whole family here!!!!!"
"I cannot say enough positive things about the team at Benchmark in Watkinsville. They make you feel like family in right at home. Matt provides the best treatment & Everyone I met there I was so kind, caring, helpful and top-notch professionals! Thank you for helping me get back to 100% and providing the best physical therapy."
"Great service and they truly listen to your symptoms to determine the best treatment for you. Open area(no closed consultation room). First day, it felt a little strange explaining my issue in front of everybody there, but I went with it. 2 days in and I'm already seeing progress!"
"I've been to Benchmark in Watkinsville for two different issues now, and I definitely recommend it to anyone with an injury or impaired mobility. Matt is a genius at figuring out why you're hurting and how to fix it. I also love that he never told me to stop doing Crossfit (which my doctor tried to do); instead, he showed me how to modify problem exercises to promote healing and increase mobility."
"When I first found out I needed to see a PT for my leg and back pain, I resisted the idea because people shared their experiences with me, and reviews were not good.  However, I decided to try it.  The facility is spotless, the front desk personnel is always pleasant and efficient and the therapist is professional and knowledgeable yet puts me at ease every time I'm there.  The exercises are not monotonous, and he's always concerned and listens to me if I need a break or I'm hurting from the exercise.  I have been amazed at how much better I feel.  These people make me feel comfortable and they make therapy fun. I highly recommend this facility!"
Excellent service and phenomenal physical therapy.
"This was my first PT experience. I had tendonitis in my elbow that limited my movement and caused pain. It was great to pain free after about 7 weeks of PT! The front desk staff was super helpful and kind. The therapist was knowledgeable and explained everything he was doing. Overall, an excellent experience."
"We highly recommend Benchmark Physical therapy! Matt the the therapist is Awesome üôå! Lindsay the office manager is Awesome as well! She is very helpful with insurance and working with your schedule for appointments.
They located on Mars Hill Rd in Oconee Co. next door to Fully Loaded Pizza."
Have really enjoyed the last couple of times I have been for therapy. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about my injury and was understanding when it came to the finances standpoint.



A hidden gem in Brookhaven for anyone needing PT. Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. No nonsense approach. They help set workable goals and a plan of exercises that will get you back on your feet with great results. Call them up first. You will be glad you did.
"Lauren and Adam make PT Solutions Brookhaven a friendly and welcoming place. They are extremely knowledgeable and there to help you. They will push you at times but in the end they do it to make you better. After 5 months of therapy with them, I can honestly say I am back to being better and injury free."
Love this facility. Staff truly cares about your experience and overall well-being! Makes PT actually enjoyable!
Very professional and pleasant to work with.  Clean office and patients and staff are properly spaced out.  I am getting great exercises and my back has not felt this good in at least a year.  The location and appointments are very convenient to my schedule.  Much appreciated.  Keep up the good work PT Solutions of Brookhaven.
"I highly recommend Lauren and Adam at PT Solutions of Brookhaven.

Highly recommend if you have back pain like me and if your job puts a lot of strain on your back."
Lauren is a real asset to the program.
"Highly recommend. Lauren and Adam generate a fun and energetic atmosphere. Lauren is my Physical Therapist, and she is gifted, patient, and a pleasure to be ""tortured"" by!"
"Lauren is truly the best physical therapist I have ever had. Knowledgeable, professional, friendly, caring and also lots of fun. Going to PT has become part of my weekly routine. I thought it would be challenging but I love going because Lauren is always so positive and once I started seeing improvements it helped with my confidence. She is helping me get back to where I used to be and probably even stronger and better both physically and mentally. Lauren, Sylvia and the rest of the staff are truly amazing. Setting an appointment at this facility is easy because they will also work around your schedule. I highly recommend this facility to anyone seeking PT treatment. Expect to be greeted with a smile by Sylvia and Lauren energetic personality."
An awesome experience even during the heart of the pandemic. Lauren is tremendously gifted and has excellent demeanor. Sylvia was also very helpful. I would strongly recommend this location for any of your PT needs.

Working to regain full use...without pain... of my left arm after a fall.  The PT Solutions Brookhaven location is easily accessible and provides maximum care and full knowledge of what we need to do together to make that happen.  The therapist is caring and professional and I feel fortunate to be working with her!
Everyone is very friendly and professional. They're good and motivating you do achieve your goals
Really great care and results. I highly recommend!
"I have been using the services of PT Solutions of Brookhaven for more than two months now, and have never encountered an unfriendly or inpatient staff member. My particular therapist is kind, encouraging, friendly and yet extremely professional."
The Physical Therapist and the entire staff is amazing. The therapist is hands on and attentive during the entire session. The best therapy my parents have ever had.
"The staff is very professional and the facility is very clean. Regardless of time, Lauren and the staff make sure to take the proper amount of time and patient care even if it runs over the allotted time. I‚Äôd highly recommend this facility and location to my loved ones."
Lauren is the ultimate in PT therapists: very knowledgable and intuitive in how to treat me. She is also hands on! Both she and Sylvia are very respectful and kind. I highly recommend PT Solutions in Brookhaven!
"I fractured my left fibula in May and had surgery.  I have been going to PT Solutions twice a week -- have had five visits to date.  I am very happy with the care the therapists are giving me.

"Lauren is a miracle worker!
Silvia provides very helpful and kind service."
"Great staff, great energy! Would definitely recommend that this is the place to go!"
"As far as ratings this place deserves 10 stars. From your first point of contact with Sylvia at the front desk, you become immediately aware that this is a patient focused facility. To say that Sylvia is most helpful, kind and quickly responsive to requests from scheduling to records is an absolute understatement. As a personal trainer who has unfortunately had their fair share of PT, Kendall and McKenzie are THE BEST in the business and that is an understatement as well. They always go above and beyond when it comes to patient care and service, as does Sylvia. Because of the time taken by Kendall and McKenzie to actually listen and evaluate my complaints thoroughly I not only have a better understanding of my body but I have became a better personal trainer due to what I‚Äôve learned coming to PT there. Many in the healthcare profession have lost their sensitivity to the fact that people‚Äôs lives are in their hands and I just don‚Äôt know how to fully express my gratitude for the concern, help and knowledge I‚Äôve received there. In addition to to my own personal benefit, Kendall identified in my therapy that something was causing irritation in my brachial plexus and went directly to ever pain point along my shoulder, neck, arm, wrist and thumb and educated me about common symptoms related to it. I proceeded to do an extensive amount of reading about it because of the intense pain related to it. Ironically enough, a few weeks later my daughter, who is a softball pitcher began experiencing identical symptoms in the same areas and most noticeably a decrease in grip strength/pain associated with gripping onto something. In the following weeks she ended up in the ER on a Thursday in the middle of the night as she awoke with intense radiating pain in the SAME areas as me (she‚Äôs broken multiple bones and had an appendectomy and NEVER cried like this before) The doctor dismissed it as a strain and sent us home and said follow up with ortho. We schedule for that Monday but Sunday at 3 am she was awoken again crying and grimacing in pain. This ER doctor said he believed something was affecting her brachial plexus and said needed an MRI but to keep appointmwnt with ortho as he would have to order it. With no sleep we go into the appointment scheduled with ortho and he quickly said she had rotator cuff tendinitis. I told him I had had tendinitis before in multiple areas and that with tendinitis the pain decreases in proportion to a decrease in activity, but he just smirked and scoffed at my insistence that there was something more serious and said go to 6 weeks of PT. As someone who has previously suffered for a year from a misdiagnosis, I was determined not to let this happen to my daughter. I demanded a second opinion and scheduled with another ortho. He ordered an MRI and found that her labrum was torn from 11-3 o‚Äôclock!!! His first instruction was for her not to lift her arm above shoulder height. Had we went straight to PT more than likely full ROM activities and other exercises would have began that would have exacerbated her condition and she would have probably ended up needing surgery whereas right now there‚Äôs a good chance it may be avoidable. I go into such detail to eludicate what a tremendous difference the care I have received has had on the quality of life for myself and my daughter. I am still trying on my journey for a proper diagnosis but without Kendall‚Äôs attention to detail I would still be floundering in pain that has now prevented me from doing my job with no direction to head in. I only wish there was more than a five star review that I could do to express the depth of my gratitude to he staff at PT solutions. They have been a blessing in my life. If you need PT rest assured you will be in the best hands possible."
Great staff with positive attitudes make this the ideal place to get better.







Loved them. They take their time figuring what will work. Ashton was wonderful! I will be going back and I‚Äôm hopeful they can help me
Ashton and Kiara both are excellent. I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else for PT.
"Sean Macko, my therapist, has been doing an outstanding job.  He used various techniques and actives which worked so well on me and my physical conditions have been improved a lot.  Thank you, Sean for the work well done."
"Clean, friendly and spacious environment. The physical therapists care about your health from minor injuries to pre-op recovery. All are extremely knowledgeable and qualified- experts in their field. At PT Solutions they understand each healthcare journey is different but rest assured they are with you every step of the way. Highly recommend if you are seeking physical therapy treatment in the Marietta- Kennesaw area!"
Staff is great however the billing process is not so great. There is never anyone there to receive payment for services. Trying to pay bills with this company is a incredible headache. Also the rates for service is only good if you have met your deductible. If you have not then it is INSANELY expensive.
"Great place to go if  PT is necessary!  Friendly people, nice clean
space for treatment. I since they are knowledgeable and will do their
best for me to have a good result. I highly recommend them to
everyone with PT needs."
The staff at PT Solutions really care about their patients and the progress they make. They listened to my concerns and discussed my goals with me than made a plan to help me achieve those goals. Thank you for your dedication.
Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. I feel like they actually care about helping me heal and are willing to seek out the cause of the problems rather than just treating the problems.
"I am really glad I chose PT solutions for my therapy. I cam in with a lot of knee pain and was affecting my daily activities. However, 4 weeks into therapy and I have little to no pain at all. My therapists are really passionate and are the BEST! I would recommend this place to all my friends!!!!"
"This clinic is very professional and accommodating. My life has changed 360 degrees with Kelly, Amy, and Kate. Physical therapy is a necessity in my life and I am so glad I came here. They truly care about you leaving feeling better than when you walked in."
"Love this place.  The Therapists are very knowledgeable and take the time to explain everything to you so you have a clear understanding of what the plan is to pain free living.  They are friendly, easy to talk to and very professional."
Great group!! They listen and work with you. They have made a difference it my life for sure. I highly recommend them at 1615 Ridenour.üòÑ
I‚Äôve been here for about 2 months and can say without a doubt Kaitlyn has given me all the tools I need to keep the pain away. Highly recommend coming here.
"I have recently began PT with PT Solutions . All the staff are very personal and encouraging.
They are very professional as well as very qualified. They treat you very kind and do not push you beyond your point of pain.
Very clean and well maintained clinic."
The Staff is awesome - very kind and caring and they listen to my concerns regarding my therapy. Front office staff is very professional and they are customer service focused - which is refreshing in today's world!
Very friendly staff that made me feel like I was the only patient in the office. Kelly my therapist was wonderful explaining my goals for recovery.
"Exceptional and very friendly, knowledgeable staff, great place to get back to you!"
"Their staff is extremely knowledgeable and helping. Both DeRon and John have an expansive understanding of their field. They are very accommodating to their patients in both time and attention. I would recommend this practice to anyone seeking physical therapy. I always leave rhis place feeling better than when I entered and most importantly, with a smile."
"This location misquoted me by over $3000. I went there for 2 months, paying every day I went, before I got a fishy bill that said I owed this extra money. When I talked to the location about it, they admitted to the mistake and then said that I would still need to cover the more than $3000 FOR THEIR MISTAKE. Watch your wallet here! I bought into the whole ""treat you like family"" sales pitch all the way until the end."
Top-notch physical therapists and extraordinary patient care. PT Solutions treats their clients like family and you will see results!!
Everyone at PT makes me want to work hard and succeed.
"Staff is knowledgeable, kind and helpful."
Wonderful caring people.









This place is amazing! All the staff of super friendly and caring! They do an amazing job making sure you are taking care of and nothing is bothering you while doing the exercises! Great service and highly recommend if you need physical therapy to get back on your feet!
Barnesville Rehab was a great place to go to for therapy. The staff are awesome üòä. They know what they are doing and they work you well with out overdoing it. They're all very pleasant and polite to work with. I would recommend them any day.
"They are the kindest people and they know how to work different approaches for different people .They quickly create rehab efforts for different people and different injuries!!! All within the doctor s orders.
I highly recommended these highly skilled restorers of health.."
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! They care so much about their patients and like to keep it fun for everyone. Such a fun and family friendly environment.
The entire staff at Barnesville Rehab Solutions exemplify the meaning of care and compassion. The therapists are knowledgeable and dedicated to help you meet your therapy goals.
"Good people, Careening, Awesome Therapy skills for whatever part of your body needs treatment. Three weeks in for shoulder rehab and range of motion and strength are both improving fantastically."
Excellant place very friendly staff. The dry needling is awesome and it helps so much. The staff is very knowledgeable about many different conditions and they do their best to get you better
"This is the best physical therapy practice I have ever attended. You get one-on-one treatment, they don't overbook clients, self pay pricing is reasonable, Daniel (Dr. Voight) is very knowledgeable, discusses treatment in terms you understand, there is never a wait, the equipment all works very well and each patient is treated to their specific needs. He encourages questions, communicates with your doctors and  best of all he listens! Melissa in the office is also great and works with you on insurance and finances. They always have a smile!"
Excellent!



"I highly recommend PT Solutions of Duluth, GA for their professionalism,and efficiency.  From the front desk to the therapists, they show they care about the patient.  They understand your needs and go the extra mile for you. They have exceeded my expectations, and I am very happy about their technical skills and customer service."
I have been working with Dani Safstrom.  She is calm and collective and very kind to work with.  She answers my many questions and is good at what she does.  The dry needling has been amazing.  Highly recommend this location.
Great staff they took great care of my son
"I wish I could give this place 10 stars! They deserve it, amazing crew, Dani and Selena are awesome!"
"Dani is awesome. She is friendly, knowledgeable and professional. I would definitely recommend her for your PT services. The office staff is friendly here as well."
"Awesome place! The staff is friendly, courteous and professional! Dani is amazing. knowledgeable and supportive..."
I've been recently attending PT Solutions in Duluth Ga for physical therapy for neck and balance issues. I would give a 5 star. Everyone there is professional and friendly. I would definitely recommend them.
The staff is very sensitive to the client's needs yet firm to their medical necessities.   They are very welcoming and make you work for your health. They keep you educated on the stages of the process you are going through that enables your body to heal so that you have a better understanding of what is going on.
"Best service by far! We have been at PT Solutions once before for our travel soccer player with some knee problems. Jack was able to work with my son to get the ""problem"" fixed in working on the muscle groups that need to be strengthened. We have come back to Jack for working on strengthening my son;s back muscles. Jack and his group are very experienced and also very flexible on accommodating our busy schedule."
"The ladies here have always been personable, professional, and knowledgeable. I appreciate their sensitivity to my pain yet their firmness and clarity in directions."
The Doctor andcthe therapists are awesome. Only complaint it‚Äôs hard to get appointments they are always booked.
"I've been recently attending PT Solutions for physical therapy and the experience is undoubtful 5 star rating. The entire staff is professional, very acknowledgable and very attentive to each patience needs. I've been in a horrible auto accident a long time ago and due to my age, my pain has caught up which had me visit various physical therapy clinics but PT Solutions is far by the best ive seen and believe me, I've seen them all."
I had an abdominal strain that prevented me from running 8 weeks before a big race.  Zach at PT Solutions was able to rehab me with isolation exercises and strength training in just 4 weeks and got me back out running without pain!
Phone operator isn‚Äôt friendly ....when I do not get great phone service I take my business elsewhere!
Wonderful Experience!







"I came here because of an exercise induced injury that left me with pain during normal exercise and daily activity. As someone who is very active, this was extremely frustrating. Andrew and the rest of the team have been awesome in helping me on becoming pain free. All of the employees are so nice and welcoming and I enjoyed coming here because of the environment that they created. Thank you Andrew for all of your help!"
"The staff are wonderful. The front desk people are professional and efficient. Both physical therapists who worked with me were very committed to helping me get stronger so I can overcome my injury.
They are never judgmental. They are always supportive.  I saw how other staff treated all types of clients. Every one who works at Benchmark on 120 demonstrates caring and competence."
"This is the second time I have used BenchMark, first time at the East Lake office.  On both occasions I have found them to be very effective in correcting or strengthening specific areas of my body that were not working optimally.  Jordan and her team prescribed appropriate exercises, led me through two sessions a week and gave me my own take-home exercise instructions to assure continued progress.  There was significant improvement in the strength of my ankle which will allow me to enjoy a golf trip to Ireland in September!"
FANTASTIC care here. Thank you Andrew for helping me get the use of my right arm back after my shoulder surgery. The staff here is also caring and friendly.
"Excellent facility. Jordan helped me get back to 110% after I had surgery to repair a torn ankle tendon. Courtney at the front desk creates a welcoming environment, efficiently handing everything from scheduling to billing."
Dr. Drew and his staff are awesome! The knee and all my old bones and joints are feeling so much better. I'm back on the tennis courts already!
"The entire staff @ Benchmark is so kind & professional. However, I must acknowledge Andrew Drill & Courtney as outstanding employees. Thanks to them, I went from reluctant to get PT (avoiding it for months after my orthopedic had prescribed it) to wishing treatment didn‚Äôt have to end!!!! Andrew‚Äôs commitment to helping me achieve my goals enabled results that exceeded my expectations! I highly recommend Benchmark & am forever grateful for the incredible treatment I received."
"Benchmark was awesome! Honestly, I was not looking forward to going to physical therapy, but Andrew was patient and personable. He made the whole experience so great! 10/10 would recommend."
"This is the best best physical therapy, i have ever had. Andrew is so knowledgeable and caring, it is amazing how my knees feel 110% better. If you have a choice come here and ask for andrew. He really knows his stuff. Thank you Andrew and benchmark for caring."
"Awesome establishment, very informative and thorough. Felt really comfortable and confident in the entire staff . Highly recommended."
My daughter said the following: My foot used to hurt during my sports but once I started going to Benchmark pt my foot did not hurt. Mr Andrew was great and made it fun. Definitely go there.
I worked with Andrew he is the best! When I first came to therapy I could barely walk but I am doing great now. And I am doing things I didn't think I could. This is the place to be.
I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this location to ALL my friends and family. All the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They are easy to talk to and fun to work with. They helped me overcome back pain and heal much more quickly than if I were to have done it on my own. THANKS SO MUCH to everyone at this location in having an active part in my recovery.
"I had, emphasis 'had', a 'frozen shoulder' for months but after just a few sessions with Jordan, Philip, and Samantha I'm nearly back to full range of motion, plus it's getting better all the time - and no pain. They are *Great!*"
Not everyone wants to talk/chat constantly during sessions.  Some personalities are more prone to getting down to business and keep it moving forward without the dialogue.   It‚Äôs also very odd to have other non-treatment/therapy session staff hovering while treatment is taking place.  I feel like I‚Äôm being stared at by someone just off from my peripheral that‚Äôs watching.  Very odd feeling.
Very much the tops in skilled & personalized care. I recommend with accolades.
Andrew did a great job helping with my shoulder pain. Would definitely recommend and use in the future.
"Professional, thoughtful and dedicated to patient improvement. I would highly recommend Jordan and the staff at Benchmark Hwy 120, Marietta."
"I am so very fortunate to have been directed to go to Benchmark for my physical therapy concerning tension headaches. Andrew Drill is one incredible therapist. Not only is he patient with me but he is also a therapist who treats the whole patient. Working with me concerning my headaches, he is also making me aware of other aspects of my physical state, such as improving my  posture and hip placemenr, which can contribute to my headaches. I cannot say enough about how caring and professional Andrew is. His expertise is an answer to years of having no help in managing these aches. I am impressed with the entire personnel at Benchmark. Thank you for your care...."
The entire staff is phenomenal. I always felt welcomed and pampered. Dr. Andrew is the epitome of a care giver. Many Thanks guys.
The team here is awesome.  Andrew is a great coach and eases you into your program. Not that I want to go through this again but if I do I'll head to this place.
Great staff! So friendly & they are truly determined to make you feel better. 10/10 recommend!
"I was in an accident almost 4 years ago.
As a  result I have 5 herniated disc. I've been to several different Physical therapy clinics. They had big fancy office's and fancy equipment. And a one size fits all program.  BENCHMARK IS THE BEST BY FAR!  Everyone there are Great! But DR Joseph Gross wins the best Doctor of Physical Therapist of  the century award!"
Great compassionate staff. Looking forward to quick recovery.
"Staff is awesome, professional and always greet you with a smile.  Joe  is such a great therapist.  He takes time to talk to you and listens to your concerns, which is very important to me."
"I wish I could use more than 5 stars for Dr. Scott Lowe and the Benchmark PT team. They are beyond outstanding. Personal, caring, interested, and invested in patient wellness. Scott treated me for a very mundane, chronic issue, but never made it feel like anything less than the most important appointment of the day. My activities were taken into account and worked into my exercise plan. Unique exercises were created with my needs in mind. I felt listened to and respected at all times. The entire staff is a joy to be around. I would recommend Scott and Benchmark to anyone needing physical therapy."
Great staff and great service. I've already been to 5 sessions and the staff make sure your comfortable with the exercises and not over exerting yourself. They also make sure your not falling too behind. It's a great place to start your long journey back to fitness.
Great results. Friendly and attentive staff.
Everyone is amazing and so nice. Always a good time with these people. Know exactly what they are doing and so helpful!
"I broke my knee a few months back and I‚Äôve been attending this BenchMark for my rehabilitation. I‚Äôm so glad I found them! Jo and Scott really know their stuff. They take the time to explain things, they‚Äôre upbeat and positive, they really support and encourage you in your rehab. PT isn‚Äôt exactly fun but I genuinely look forward to coming here, and working hard on my rehab. The facility is spotless, and they are supported by a team of great admin and PT assistants. I‚Äôd highly recommend them to friends, family and anyone searching for a professional, enthusiastic, PT facility in the East Cobb area."
"Everyone at this location is a delight--from the administrative staff to the therapists and PT students. I've been to Scott before in 2015/2016 and actually switched from a different PT back to Scott with my most recent surgery.

Everyone here works to get to know you personally and to help you work toward your individual PT goals. The equipment is new, clean, and well-maintained. I recommend Benchmark and Scott to all my friends who may need PT. They make it easy and even fun. :)"
"Joe is the best, except for those calf raises. He really likes those! :)"
"I have been going to this facility for my ankle recovery after surgery since it is so close and convenient. Added bonus Scott and Emma have been great. Scott listens to all my feedback and gives considered detailed responses, that I find helpful as I am that kind of person who appreciates more detail, and am the curious type.

Just overall very happy to be able to get such good care so close to home."
"Excellent! Joe is a highly skilled therapist and Taylor, Tina and Phil are a talented support staff. They have created a kind, supportive environment to promote healing, and even manage to make PT fun! They are the best!
I‚Äôve also had the pleasure of seeing Meg, and she is also wonderful."
"Dr. Scott is incredible with his treatments and knows how to assess injuries very well. It can be known that he likes what he does and is very knowledgeable. His office coordinator, Emma is very organized and gets paper work done in a timely manner. They are very nice people and awesome to work with!"
I've been bringing my 11 year old son here to see Scott for about 2 weeks now. We have seen immediate results! Emma was super helpful getting us in to start the very next day.  The facility is great. We are very happy with the entire experience. I definitly recommend it!
"This particular Benchmark is the best one in the state of Ga. Credit goes to the people who work here. Scott is the physical therapist and Emma is the  can do everything person. Scott knows everything about the body and how to make it better. What is the best, he is so friendly  and encouraging."
"Fantastic Benchmark Physical Therapy clinic! I have multiple joint problems that have plagued me for years and I finally made the decision to have physical therapy. I am 65 years young and was determined to take my life long aches and severe pain to see if ANYTHING could be done. In a matter of weeks Scott has made wonderful improvements to lessen my pain, improve my range of motion and teach me techniques and exercises for me to do at home. These exercises have helped move my recovery along. I now feel confident that I will be able to hike and bicycle again and spend more time walking out of doors. A heartfelt thank you to Scott and your staff!!"
Very friendly and courteous staff. They made every effort to make sure i was comfortable and took the time to explain all of the steps and let me do them at my own pace.
"I suffered an injury to both knees in December 2017 that involved MCL, ACL, and cartilage damage. I didn‚Äôt begin physical therapy at Benchmark until the end of January 2018. I was barely walking and I was using a walker sometimes. I had very little range of motion to my legs and my muscles were very weak. I didn‚Äôt see how I would even come close to returning to my normal function before the injury. My first appointment, I met Scott. He was very patient and explained everything to me to the smallest detail. He gave me my home exercises and I was scheduled for physical therapy appointments 3 days per week initially. Well, here I am now, in April 2018 and I am feeling great! I am walking normally, I have regained strength in my legs, and my knee injuries are healed. I still have some work to do to move towards running, jumping, skipping, and hopping but I am very encouraged. The entire staff at Benchmark are AWESOME!!! Scott is very knowledgeable, detail oriented, and prepares you for each step along the physical therapy process. Joe gave me confidence to progress through the therapy when I didn‚Äôt think I was ready to do so. Cameron cheered me along the entire way and inspired me to push through the tough days. Christina kept me motivated and focused during my therapy sessions. Abby is the sweetest and most helpful receptionist ever. Taylor always greeted me with a bright smile and offered a helping hand. I am beyond grateful for the entire team‚Äôs help and expertise. There is absolutely no other place I would return to for physical therapy or recommend to anyone for physical therapy."
"Great informative staff, fantastic way to start the journey back to your best self"
"Very nice staff, very clean and bright positive atmosphere."
"I started at Benchmark around 4/5/2018 And my experience thus far has been great,thank you to Cynthia, Scott my therapist,Maggie, Catherine and Scott assistant..You all are the bomb..and thank you for your kindness and professionalism."
Scott and the group here is great. I really appreciate them getting me 100% ready for the Pan American Weightlifting Championships.
"Excellent assistance, Excellent care, and Excellent communication is still not enough to describe the work done by Dr. Scott and Ms. Emma. They make you comfortable and tend to all your needs while making sure you get back to 110% health!!!!"
"Awesome PT from Scott and his crew, best PT place ever great work and I‚Äôm getting much better after every visit."
To say I am a very satisfied customer is an understatement.  I am ecstatic that my ailments are improving so much from this very talented team!
I have endured multiple sports related injuries and done PT with many different therapists.  Scott Lowe and Benchmark are the best around.  I'll never go anywhere else.
Scott was phenomenal to work with- I broke my wrist back in Nov and am doing great after surgery and rehab. Highly recommended!!
"This practice is wonderful! The practitioners and staff are kind and knowledgeable, and the space is inviting and professional."
I have been so pleased with my therapy here  They were able to help me identify moves that immediately began relieving pain and have since been working on strengthening so that for the first time in years I‚Äôm hopeful that I won‚Äôt have another relapse. I wouldn‚Äôt have nearly the mobility I currently do without the people here!
"Scott & Emma are very friendly and professional. I would recommend Benchmark PT at this location (2100
Roswell Rd.)"
"Great staff, experienced and friendly !"
"Excellent, great staff. Highly recommended."
Very experienced professionals with a friendly environment.
"I recovered from shoulder surgery with limited rotation and flexibility.  I worked with Jordyn as my PT.  She was both personable and motivating while exhibiting the right amount of patience during each session.  Scheduling was also flexible with each patient being given the right amount of attention.  My progress was tested consistently with accurate and honest feedback.  The entire staff worked as one unit to maintain customer engagement.  Overall, you should choose this location if you are looking to regain your physical and mental capabilities."






They are an awesome bunch that are highly trained to take care of all your needs. I recommend everyone I speak with to go to them. Super nice and really helped me with back and neck pain as well as my headaches.  They even put up with me so that is a big plus for them. I have a few friends going to them now that I told them to make sure to ask for them to be scheduled with Benchmark ans they love them too
Very polite and professional üëç
New location with open floor plan and friendly staff.  I had a great experience

"ATI is great!

It‚Äôs a clean, knowledgeable and professional atmosphere.

They are smiling from the moment you check in!

The therapist and assistants work hard, work together and make it successful for your journey!

My personal experience is with PT: Holly! I chose Holly, from research I did. I advise you to do the same.

I had a total right knee replacement on 9/21/21. Dr. Siffri from Steadman Hawkins did mine.

Holly had great reviews from multiple patients that had undergone knee replacements.

Per my personal experience Holly has been wonderful, and I am very glad I chose her.  She‚Äôs truly exceptional! She listens, cares, understands frustrations I‚Äôve encountered as well as cheers me on! She pays attention to details, which is important!

If you‚Äôve undergone a total knee replacement, I encourage you to ask for Holly. I promise you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

My journey isn‚Äôt done yet, but‚Ä¶Holly, thank you!!!

Andrea B."
"Everyone here is amazing. Abbey mostly worked with me, but I also saw Rachel, Sally, and others. They were all very friendly, knowledgeable, and personable. I would recommend this team to anyone seeking physical therapy!"
"I just wrapped up 13 weeks of PT for an ankle surgery. Abby G and Sally have both been crucial to my recovery. Their knowledge, technique, and constant encouragement as well as gentle pushes have helped me rehab my foot to place where it is even better and more functional than prior to my injury. The facility has all of the tools needed for successful treatment and the atmosphere is one of positivity and achievement. I never felt pressured to do more than I was able, but was definitely guided to do my best and continue to improve. I am very grateful for the care I have received from Abby and Sally and would recommend them to anyone with enthusiasm and confidence. THANK YOU BOTH!"
"So grateful for ATI, great help in getting me back together! LOL! Wendy is a excellent instructor and caring person. She has introduced new exercises each week making my arm/shoulder be able to move easier. ATI is committed to helping each of us get better. Love ATI"
"Absolutely the best!!! Extremely professional and caring. Abigail G. was awesome from day 1. I was a patient for nearly 10 months following my surgery. Abby took the time to get to know me as a patient and person. She put together the perfect plan to get me back on my feet. Not only are they top notch with their care, I developed a friendship with most everyone there. Going to ATI was very personal for me. I enjoyed going to every session and looked forward to seeing everyone.  It was bitter, sweet at my last session knowing that I would not get to see my friends twice a week like I have been for the previous months."
Outstanding experience for PT after knee replacement.  Clear knowledge to create and make a plan for progress and enough encouragement and push to keep motivation for improvement. Holly and Corissa and the entire team made this a wonderful experience! Plenty of variety and challenges to keep exercise interesting.
"My physical therapists were Becca and Christen who were really amazing the whole time. I had a previous ACL and meniscus injury from high school sports,  that happened years ago and I re-injured both this year. They helped me after my surgery and they were patient, knowledgeable and communicated. I hate being in pain and I had bad days but these guys went above and beyond to assist me."
"I have been thrilled with my experience at ATI. The staff are all very competent in their positions, from arrival to departure. The focus is always my pain level, my progress, and well being. I love the attention and the sense of accomplishment and encouragement the therapists provide. Highly recommend!"
Wonderful experience with a staff that really cares and work together well as a team. Special mention and gratitude to Abby. Also Ashton and Berman. You guys are awesome!!!
Great and friendly therapists. They keep the exercises interesting yet helpful. I felt I was given the knowledge to complete my therapy at home and feel comfortable to call anytime if I ever have concerns. Thank you for all the staff for their compassion and hard work!
I could not have picked a better place to go they make you feel at home when you there they make sure that you are comfortable and whatever position that you are in why they're working with you they are friendly they're always smiling and happy when you goes in they give their all making sure that you're feeling better when you leave it's a good place to goüòÉüòÉ
"Amy B has been great! She is very positive, always in a great mood! No complaints from me"
Everyone is very nice and helpful there. I recommend it for a great rehab experience.
"I took my exercise plan and added more at home during my recovery.  Everyone was great with suggestions and I was able to loose 25 lbs. in the process.   I now now have a great exercise plan that was jump started at ATI!  Not only am I rehabbed from surgery but I have a great work routine that the ladies at ATI helped me with.  Thank you Ann, Wendy, Kristen, and everyone else who had to watch, count reps or keep up with me during this my journey!"
"This is a fantastic place. The staff of therapists are very professional and caring...
I thank Amy, Christen and Sally for lovingly helping me reach my goals of using my knee after a complete knee replacement...these ladies are great. I recommend this place highly !"
"This caring group of people design a personalized program for each person and implement it with  professionalism and a skillful eye on progression and pain.
I can‚Äôt say enough about working with Josh -Upon not feeling well at a visit -  he was very concerned which resulted in learning I had dangerously high blood pressure which required immediate attention and treatment .
Their first concern is the person while working to achieve the goals."
Works me to improve but with a smile and friendly and courteous manner.  They always clean the machine or table that I will use.
"Very friendly and professional staff.  I‚Äôve never had to wait past my appointment time to be seen.  Very helpful, they ask good questions to determine how I‚Äôm doing and encourage me to ask good questions.  The best part is they are helping me feel better!"
"I am receiving therapy for my shoulder.
I have been very pleased with the quality of service from every person that has worked with  me.
The therapists are very professional and friendly.  They are cautious and check to see if you are ok and doing your exercises correctly.
One thing I have noticed is how everyone works together which keeps things moving smoothly.  It is nice to see.
The front desk employees greet you and make you feel welcome.
This is my second time receiving therapy at this location, and I would highly recommend this location to anyone in need of physical therapy."
"My daughter has had the best experience so far with her PT at ATI!  The staff has been kind, welcoming, and professional.  Her recovery from reconstructive knee surgery is going as good as can be, and she is excited to go to her next appointment.  Thank you Abi, Sally, and Josh at ATI!"
"Having PT for the first time with ATI. So far, it's been a 5 star performance by everyone, from check in, to the two therapist I've seen so far, Rae Ann and Holly. Everyone is so nice and helpful."
My experience has been great.  The team there is awesome.  I am so glad that I attend ATI for my therapy.  The professionalism and knowledge that they share is remarkable.  I feel as though they have a genuine concern for my well being.  They give me the utmost care and respect.
"Staff was very friendly.  My physical therapist, Holly, was awesome!  She was very attentive.  She listened and addressed my concerns.  Holly made me feel comfortable in an uncomfortable situation.  I would absolutely recommend!"
This is my second time coming to the Simpsonville ATI. My experiences with them both times has been great.  The physical therapists work with you one-on-one to make sure that you are receiving the right kind of care that you need. Everyone is friendly and makes you feel like you are a part of the team. If there are exercises that you feel uncomfortable doing they don't push you into doing them. And before you leave they make sure that you have gotten the care that you needed. They are thorough with scheduling and coming to get you on time in the waiting area. I recommend anyone that needs physical therapy to go with this place.
"Therapist are very helpful and excited to get you on a path of recovery or maintenance rebuilding your muscle loss. They are also very understanding when it comes to appointments and scheduling you for your needs! Personality‚Äôs are amazing! Front desk staff is fast with no errors to check you in and out, plus even when busy so very kind and respectful!!!"
I had physical therapy for my arms and my back. I am very thankful for all the help that I received from the staff. Everyone was very nice and I would HIGHLY recommend this facility to others. My main therapists were Holly and Kristen. These ladies were phenomenal!!!! Thank y'all so very much!
"Rae Ann was a great at my therapy, very understanding. Sally was great as well. The staff very nice and always busy and cleaning everything. Would highly recommend. Thanks for the help I received."
"Your group of therapists are simply awesome.   They have to listen to all of us, lol.  They're like a free mental health worker.  Love my therapists Abby and Sally."
"I had a great experience with Josh and the rest of the team at this facility. Check in and out was quick and simple, the front desk workers were always helpful and friendly.  I was a little skeptical at first, but after my series of treatments I noticed a definite improvement with my knee pain. The facility was clean and well organized."
Friendly staff that listens to you and works you towards recovery.  Pushes you to work hard to recover quickly from surgery
"I recently ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù from ATI-Simpsonville and felt compelled to write a review. During my stay, I had three different therapists but primarily one, Becca. Becca proved to be very knowledgeable, professional in her dealings with me and other patients and colleagues. She challenged me from one visit to the next, adding additional weight/xercises as needed. Her people skills made my visits enjoyable and successful. Becca is truly a credit to her profession!"
Holly does an amazing job of workibg with me and knowing exactly how far to push me and give me new exercises to help my recovery!
"I have been going to ATI in Simpsonville for a few weeks now. Holly and Sally are helping me  gain mobility back in my knee after full knee replacement. They have pushed me and helped me attain my personal goals for each week. They are showing me new ways each day to help stretch, bend, and move to get back to 100%. I am pleased with the way they clean the equipment to make sure everything is sanitized for me."
"The therapist here are knowledge, patient and friendly.  I appreciate the time taken to show me and  let me know I'm doing therapy correctly, without rushing me."
After a total knee replacement Holly and Kristen guided me on my rehab road to recovery. I am back to doing what I love and can't thank them enough for their knowledge and inspiration.
Didn't fix me didn't seem to know how to fix me didn't seem to care about fixing me waste of my time and money
Everyone is nice and helpful. Very concerned about your well-being.
Great experience with physical therapy at ATI.  My therapist Holly and Carisa were awesome!! I would definitely recommend ATI.
"After having knee replacement surgery I started therapy at ATI in Simpsonville, S.C. I found this to be a well organized clinic.  The therapist and staff were very helpful and listened to all my concerns.  Also, equipment was cleaned and sprayed after/before each use.  I would definitely recommend ATI in Simpsonville, S.C."
"Staff are very welcoming, knowledgeable, professional, and they were effective at addressing my recovery from hip replacement surgery. Katie and Danielle are the best."
"I have a pleasure of working with Wendy Friday at the ATI Simpsonville, Hillcrest Hospital location after my reverse shoulder replacement. I have known her from  previous ATI visits, and I was thrilled to be asign to her again.
Wendy is a very knowledgeable physical therapy professional, always in tune with each patient abilities and needs. She is a careful listener and encourager. She gladly offers detailed and helpful explanations of joint mechanics and reasoning for performing each excercise in a certain way, which is a great motivator for me. I love Wendy's positive and friendly predisposition, and a nice smile which make me  look forward to my next ATI sessions."
This is a great place for therapy. I am on 4th time a round for different issues.
I have been working with Abigail Geary.  She is very professional.  She has such a light touch and knows how to maneuver my arm in just the right way.  She has taught me many exercises I can do at home to improve my range of motion. I would highly recommend ATI.
"The strengths of ATI include rapid schedule availability and convenient locations throughout Greenville. The weaknesses in my experience have included a lack of communication regarding therapy goals and lack of identification of expected symptomatic response to treatment. My therapy involves assessment and treatment of my cervical spine. In the first week, my pain had been considerably higher than before treatment, and I wish that there had been some other communication channels available to share potential outcomes and response to treatment that would have allowed me to be better prepared."
Everyone is very nice & pleasent when speaking to the patients. I have Wendy & Beverly helping me & they are so wonderful.
"Every one at ATI is extremely friendly, courteous, and always greeting individuals with a smile. The therapists are very knowledgeable, and seem to honestly enjoy what they are doing."
I've been here 8 years ago and there still really sweet people that know what there doing
The staff is very professional and nice!
It's a pleasant place for  therapy because everyone is so kind and helpful and hands-on and friendly i just enjoy my visits
This is a very good place staff are very nice and friendly. They don‚Äôt take long they help you & get you in and out.
"I started having shoulder pain in both of my shoulders about 3 years ago. Moderate to severe at times and had no clue as to why. I was sent to physical therapy for the first time ever, not ATI, and I didn‚Äôt think that it was beneficial and a waste of time. Nothing was changing. Enters Dr. Siffri and the first of 3 surgeries, on my shoulders. Sending me to ATI woke me up and helped me see that surgery does repair the joints, but it doesn‚Äôt bring those joints back to life. With ATI, I have been supported completely, not just during my sessions, but also after hours. This group actually cares about each individual and that individual‚Äôs progress and wellbeing. Thank you Josh and Holly for being the absolute best! I know that I am literally in the best hands!!!!"
The team at ATI has been very attentive and helpful. I am feeling pretty good!
"The trainers are knowledgeable and caring. Holly, Amy and Christen have been wonderful"
"This is the Best Team that I have ever had help me recover from any injury. Yes I have been to this group in the past. It‚Äôs a shame that this team is gonna be torn apart soon because of changes being made. Thank you Ladies for a wonderful experience recovering from My injuries. God Bless Y‚Äôall.

"Left knee was quite painful after PT on March 29th.
Today's (3/31/21) Physical Therapy went much better."
They give me chances to become more comfortable with my rehab towards my body. They push me while knowing limits.
They have the best Physical Therapist and they really care about your well being. I was recovering from knee replacement and I told my therapist how bad my calf was hurting.  Right away he went and spoke with my Doctor and my Doctor sent me for a test and I had a blood clot. If it wasn't for my PT they wouldn't have known about the blot clot.
"Excellent facility, staffed with exceptional personnel.
They take their time with you finding out what your issues are and what they can do to help you regain your mobility.
Initially I was afraid I would not be able to participate as my back is not well
However,  I was assured that with a little patience I could.
Overall very nice group of caring individuals.
Highly recommend them for anyone needing physical therapy!!!"
ATI was very helpful after my ankle surgery. Josh was super helpful really pushed me to get back to my normal self!
The staff is friendly and care about the patients wellbeing.
Kristen is great as a physical therapist! She is helping me overcome a recent back injury and learn exercises that are strengthening my core.
Everyone at ATI have been very professional and determined to help me reach my goals
My Physical therapist Tiffany was the greatest person to have helping me out. She was strict when needed to be but would make jokes and was very easy to talk to. She is definitely someone you want to help you out with your knee. She made things do able and I am now able to do everything I couldn't before
The staff was very nice and helpful. I think what we are doing is actually helping.
The staff was very nice and helpful.   I think what we are doing is actually helping.
Knowledgeable and patient everyone there is helpful
"My experience with the PT therapist here was excellent. I would easily give this office ten stars IF the front desk had not verified with me that I would be paying an amount per visit ONLY, because my husband was a hospital employee. Six months later I received a bill for over $500. After a month of trying to find out who had billed me incorrectly, I learn that the information I received originally was incorrect and I will have to pay the bill in its entirety. There‚Äôs something wrong with that kind of customer service. If I can‚Äôt trust a medical office‚Äôs business practices, I would not return there if I was paid to do so."
Very good nice people and very helpful
"Great staff and environment for physical therapy. My husband and I have been to 4 different PT clinics for various rehab and like the ATI location at Hillcrest Hospital in Simpsonville the best. All the therapists as well as the front desk staff are professional, caring and even ‚Äúfun‚Äù to be around.  Evelyn Larson"
"ATI is the best. I have been to several Physical Therapy but Hillcrest ATI is the best one. I had surgery on my right ankle and if it wasn't for ATI I wouldn't be walking today. I highly recommend them to everyone. They are the Best. I want to recognize the ones that help me not once but 3 times. Nadyne, Wade, Sally and Holly. They were the best. I came back two more times after my surgery because my left ankle was hurting bad and I didn't want to have surgery again. Well I came back to the right ones. Nadyne, Wade and Sally got me back on track. I also want to recognize Mike and Tommy. Mike made sure I had the right pad to do my execercise. Him and Tommy were very nice too. I didn't just gain friends at ATI Physcal Therapy at Hillcrest Hospital. I gained a family. I just want to tell you that I love you all. If I ever need Therapy again. I will tell my doctors to send me to ATI Hillcrest. Thanks for helping me to walk again."
"Josh is my PT at the Hillcrest office. He is absolutely outstanding! Very professional yet personable.  He is doing therapy on my shoulder and in 3 sessions,  my pain and range of motion is SO MUCH BETTER! I am looking forward to working with him as my therapy continues! I can't imagine going anywhere else after seeing such a great improvement in such a short time!"
Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Clean and safe equipment. Positive environment. Professional all around.
This place is awesome.
I had a very nice Therapist Tiffany Lambert- Lucas my first day. She explained the exercises that I was to do and how many times for each. I have been doing them at home and they seem to be working good for me.
On time and very efficient!
"Abby is great at what she does. Kind, caring and compassionate. ATI is a great place for physical therapy"
Wade and Holly are amazing. My PT has been amazing. All the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
Really nice folks who seem to genuinely care.
"When you arrive, you must have the receptionist get on the phone with your insurance provider and determine exactly how much they will be charging you for each of your visits.  They will take a $20 payment, which you think they are communicating with your insurance provider; so you know the charges.  Not so, and they will tell you later that they were taking the $20 as a convenience.  Convenience for who?  Then they will send you the full bill with whatever the insurance provider does not cover.  Their staff is going to try to set you up for 3 appointments per week, and then you will get a bill 45 days from the date of your first appointment for the whole first month.  If you go the 3 times per week, it can be more than $1,000 out of pocket.  They will take no responsibility for any miscommunication on their part, either."
Love the staff and how they work to the best of their ability to help you.
Great
"The staff are very informative as to what we will do and the benefits from it. Very kind, professional and compassionate. Thank you"
Abby and Ann have been amazing!! They are helping me get my knee back I. Working order post op!!!
"Professional, efficient, knowledgeable, personable"
"Went 3x, paid $75 a visit after being told that was the amount with my insurance, then get a bill for $217.16.  Each visit, was the same, but each day they charged me a different amount.  Call the billing number on the bill for an explanation and got a half a** response. I have gone to another PT facility in Simpsonville, not yet meeting my deductible also, and never was out of pocket so much money.  They are very deceptive and I will never go there again or recommend them to anyone.  Stay Away!!!!

TO reply to your REPLY:  I called them and they knew nothing and could not explain why on 3 different sessions was charged different amounts. I am in process of finding a way to report you to either BBB, State Medical, etc"
I start back in April of lat year for my knee then April this year for my shoulder for therapy I love them. They are so good &  caring. So Thank Wendy & Collen for your caring.
Their willingness to work with you and their knowledge to do so is the best!
A very good staff and take their time with you in doing your physical therapy
"Really nice people and try to help much as possible.
Chris B."

Fantastic!  Wade Harrell help me go from hobbling around on a bad knee to playing tennis three times a week.

"A huge thank you to the staff at PT Solutions at Vickery Village. Mike is one of the kindest and most sincere people I‚Äôve worked with through my journey to recovery. He knows exactly what I need and has been very encouraging through the process. I was in a lot of pain when I first started. I‚Äôm pretty much pain-free after working with Mike. I also want to acknowledge Sharia who has always been so polite, kind and professional!"
"Zac is a skilled and thoughtful physical therapist. He has knack for figuring out what‚Äôs going on with you and how he can help you work through it. The facility is so nice, well-equipped and conveniently located. Zac and his staff are incredibly friendly. I never knew PT could actually be fun! My shoulder was in rough shape when I started and now I‚Äôm back to doing shoulder presses at the gym just a few weeks later. Highly recommend!"
"This location is outstanding.  Zack, the physical therapist, is amazing.  I had back surgery to replace a disk and fuse L4/L5.  I had also bilateral hip replacement recently and needed both back and hip physical therapy.  Zack has gotten me back on my feet and ready to get back in the gym.  He deserves more than 5 stars."
I recommend pt solutions to anyone with an injury because I had such a great experience . Zach was extremely helpful and polite as he drove me to push myself throughout my healing process. Now i‚Äôm back out and able to do any activity I want.
"Mr. Zac is a really good Physical Therapist.
Ever since I have been coming here, I have got a lot better. He pushes me harder to get better, so I can play soccer again.
When I am done with physical therapy I will remember that Zac And I had a juggling contest and he made me go first, so if I got a lot he would put his other shoes on.
157 to 130
I won, but him and I both thought he was going to beat me!"
If you want recovery and healing go and see Dr Zachary Moore.  This guy is the best physical therapist in the great state of Georgia.  You will not be disappointed.  If you are injured and hurting he can help you.  Go.
I had a great experience at PT Solutions of Vickery Village!  Zac helped me so much with my back and knees.  I left with lots of ideas to use at home.  Highly recommend Zac and PT Solutions Vickery to anyone!
Went in for a hip flexor injury and walked away pain free. Zach is awesome!

I don't know if I would stick it out if it wasn't for Rachel. I'm getting the treatment I need but I'm also getting very educated on my condition.  This is truly top notch.
"I had eight sessions and right from the beginning, the experience was wonderful. Very relaxed atmosphere and understanding that recovery is a painful process, and very capable professionals there to guide you through it. They were always very accommodating of my scheduling issues and sent text reminders as well as filling out physical cards for me. I know I wouldn't be walking without my brace if it wasn't for these guys."
Very flexible.


"It works, if you work it. But, you gotta work it every day and night!"

Josh is one of the best. He is attentive and very friendly. He definitely  knows his stuff. Small practice with big goals. I would recommend them to anyone. McKenzie  his office person is amazing too. They both truly care about their patients. If I could do better than five stars I  would.





"I have started coming since the first day of September and my experience has been amazing. Everyone is kind and understanding of the pain us patients go through. They are willing to work and adjust treatment plans for our needs. Even if you don‚Äôt see the same person, the treatment is universal between each provider. Their availability is amazing as well, which I enjoy. I would definitely recommend anyone I could to come to PT Solutions if needed."
"My son, Will, has been going to PT Solutions fir the past two weeks and LOVES it!  I‚Äôm so happy he‚Äôs having a great time with the Staff, doctors and new friends!  I think they are doing a great job of keeping him on track, building his balance and strength and teaching him how to have fun while getting healthy!  Thank you!"
"The best physical therapists I‚Äôve come across. They‚Äôre all so caring and treat you as friends. They push you and cheer you on and want you to improve! I came in not being able to walk and now I‚Äôm exceeding that with all the exercises I can do now! Each PT here has been helpful but Evan has a special place in my heart. From the initial evaluation to where I am now, he‚Äôs been nothing but a positive energy in my growth. I really appreciate everyone at this facility and I‚Äôm so happy I found it!"
This our second time here and the team has been wonderful. Very attentive and continue to work hard with my son. Week after week we can see the results of their eagerness to get him back to basketball. Thanks to the entire team.

"Again, I have been a patient at this clinic before and so has my mom. We both have been so impressed with the staff and treatment we have received!

"I've been going to PT Solutions since early July. Although I leave physical therapy everyday with my muscles on fire, I love it there!!! I tore my ACL 10 years ago and I am still rehabbing some of my leg muscles. I can see a difference in my muscle tone already. I really love how all the therapist there continue to challenge me and push me to be stronger! They really do a great job with differentiating the workouts to fit my personal needs. They're also really friendly, efficient and clean!! I would highly recommend this location (Douglasville). I can't not shoutout some of my fave physical therapists- Lisa, Assante and Morgan!! Thanks so much for working with me you all! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

"Very personable. I love going, they work you hard but it‚Äôs worth it! Lisa is the trainer I‚Äôve worked with the most and there is never a day that I go that I regret coming. I‚Äôve seen so much progress and have only been at it for a month."
Staff is awesome Lisa and Evan have been great at helping me with my shoulder.
"It is very great, Everyone is nice and asks me how I am and they help you through difficult injuries. Very best help to getting back to doing regular things after surgery."
"PT Solutions is by far the best team of Physical Therapist I have had the pleasure of working with as they provide a purpose-driven  pathway to rehabilitation. Their professional and fun demeanor coupled with their state-of-the-art facility is a winning combination. Indeed, their 5 Star rating is a reality."
I didn't get a chance to experience their service because the cost was significantly higher than other places that I am familiar with. I don't know why they are taxing so much. Oh well
All the staff are excellent but especially Lisa and Morgan.  Truly concerned about your well being.  I've been to several PT Clinics; this has been the best experience I've had.
I started physical therapy in February 2021 due to a pulled a muscle in my back that would not heal correctly. The entire staff is amazing. Everyone is helpful and have really great attitudes. I appreciate the therapists and aides for providing a comfortable atmosphere during therapy! They push me when needed and give me breaks as well! Looking forward to a great recovery with their help!
My daughter injured her lower back playing soccer. I brought her to PT solutions for Physical Therapy. The Director and staff was so friendly and professional. I was truly amazed at the  passion they have for they're clients. I highly recommend that you come and give them a try. You will not be disappointed.
"Dr. Diaz and the group at PT Solutions in Douglasville have been wonderful to work with. As a pain physician, I have referred several of my patients to their practice for treatment.

"This is a wonderful place for your rehabilitation needs. I‚Äôve been using them for my post total knee replacement rehab and have progressed quickly. The PTs, techs, assistants and students all work together to tailor a program to meet your rehab goals. My orthopedic surgeon is very pleased with the progress that I‚Äôve made in a short time. I was given the go-ahead to get on the tennis court at 7 weeks post-op! None of this progress would have happened without the expertise of PT Solutions!
Physical rehab is tough and demanding work but, you‚Äôll find the friendly and upbeat environment helps to keep you motivated."
"I love PT Solutions ! The therapists are very encouraging, supportive and understanding! You get a really good workout and leave feeling accomplished!"

All of the staff is friendly and welcoming as soon as you walk in! Would give them 15 stars if I could. 10/10 would recommend. S/o Evan. He is the best!!!"
PT Solutions in Douglasville has been great. Easy to schedule and flexible with times. They listen well and give me exercises to do at home in between appointments. Friendly staff as well. I would definitely recommend.
Everyone is really nice here!

"The staff at this location is awesome!  Assante Diaz, the director always has an awesome attitude, very knowledgeable and professional. Other staff therapists are very professional, knowledgeable and courteous. They show that they care about you from the moment you walk in until the time you leave. These are the attributes that makes a big difference."
"""Great job"" to techs & staff at D'ville location.  This is my 10th week of PT following prostrate surgery.  I 've made significant progress in recovery thanks to the individual techs who have guided and lead me in the exercises each week. Using alternating techs gives me the benefit of a wider scope of experience that each tech has.  Exercises and applications were well selected to address my needs.
Also, the senior staff provided advanced evaluation for a fainting issue I experienced during my 10 weeks of therapy.
I'd highly recommend this location and staff to any individual who needs ."
Very professional people. Taylor was very caring and helped me out a lot when I needed it. Would highly recommend.
Very patient with me.  Works me hard as they should.
"I love this place, they‚Äôre so nice and so friendly! The staff are amazing. Highly recommend them!!!"

Everyone knows what they‚Äôre doing there. Very professional and genuinely caring of my needs. Love the people there and their service. Highly recommended !
"The staff is not just professional and courteous, but they know how to remain personable with you so that the patients feel more at home. Whether a small child or a senior citizen, no one is left feeling inadequate or lost about what is happening in regards to their recovery. This is definitely a welcoming environment comprised of knowledgeable associates who are willing to continuously change up the routines so that you don‚Äôt grow weary or bored with the therapy sessions. Our family is blessed beyond words for getting to work with them."
They are awesome people who care about all their patients and make rehabilitation always fun but still profesional at all time.

"As a retired PT, I know what good care looks like! The PT Solutions clinic here in Douglasville has provided just that for me!! After a fall and apparent concussion and whiplash, I started physical therapy.  My PT and the staff that work there are very attentive and have progressed me at a rate that has been perfect for me! I noticed an improvement in balance and neck pain very soon after beginning the treatment program we set up for me!  I am thankful that we have a PT clinic in our area that is of such high standards and on the cutting edge of the medical field!"
This place is great for injury and it will help you with your weight loss goal if you have any. The staff it awesome. They will help you with anything and everything you need to get you back on track to recovery.
"At this PT, I have felt the most safe and cared for. They truly do care for their patients and their recovery. Since I began coming here they have pushed me to my limits to get me back to where I want to be. Especially the receptionist, she is the most kind and she is very flexible with schedule. Coming here does not feel like a dreaded doctors appointment. I have joy coming here.

I had a knee replacement recently and since I started coming here, my doctor tells me I am beyond my recovery time ever since starting. These people are truly great at their job."
"Excellent care from a top notch facility. The staff here genuinely care about you and your well-being. They focus on all of you, not just the injury. They push you to do more because they know you can. I would recommend them over and over."
I went to PT solutions for my post rotator cuff surgery treatment.  Douglasville is a great facility with excellent staff.  I would highly recommend using PT solutions to assist with your recovery.
Absolutely amazing staff!!! Very attentive and truly a welcoming environment.
"My son loves going to physical therapy at PT Solutions.  Very spacious environment, and loads of equipment to use while working toward your recovery.  I highly recommend their services!!!"
Love this place. The people are always friendly and accommodating. My daughter looks forward to every visit.
Got back quick and healthy 10/10 recommend this place!
This is the best by far the place to go for physical therapy. I broke my ankle two years ago and had therapy at benchmark afterwards. There facility was ok but PT Solutions is far way better and bigger. All the staff members are phenomenal üòä‚ù§Ô∏è. They all truly care about your progression and your outlook on focusing on getting better at your own pace. I recently had the hardware removed from my ankle. My first visit was with Evan and he took the time to explain how the body responses to repairing itself. This place deserves more than five üåü. If you need therapy this is definitely a place to go to.
"I knew it was the right facility for treatment from the first phone call with Evan. Evan was kind, attentive and compassionate. He listened to my concerns and provided me with accurate information. I have worked with all three clinicians and each of them is great. There's no doubt that Evan, Asante and Lisa care...they make recovery enjoyable yet challenging. Most importantly, I've made great progress and have experienced quite a bit of pain relief since starting therapy 6 weeks ago. The entire staff at PT Solutions is awesome!"
I would recommend PT SOLUTIONS  of Douglasville to anyone. I love the care they provide to my family.

"I injured some tendons in my feet and my podiatrist referred me here, and I am so glad she did. Jon has been amazing. When I first came in, he took the time to break out an anatomy book and explain to me the mechanics of my injury so I could understand what was going on with my body, which I really appreciated. He does the same thing with the exercises, explaining how each one will help with my injury. Since I've been seeing him, my feet have gotten better so much faster. His assistants and staff are also super kind, helpful, and professional. This is overall an awesome practice and I would recommend it to anyone. 12/10."

"I have appreciated the help of Dr. Diaz, Dr. Evan, and the other associates at PT Solutions.  I‚Äôve been given, what I feel is, appropriate, progressive, therapy, at a pace that is according to my physical, mental, and emotional needs.  There is great communication about the goals in recovery.  The professionalism of the staff is exceptional. They have a friendly demeanor, that helps through the difficult, sometimes very challenging exercises.  At the same time, there is not an atmosphere that is cold and detached. There is a good feel in the air. The instructions for the various exercises are explained with clarity. At times, when one misunderstands, there is gentle guidance, and reminders to stay on course, or correction of movement, with no harsh criticism, or impatience shown. One can tell they are truly interested in ones personal care and recovery.  Though some days are very busy in the facility, the staff, working with many patients, all with their own personal challenges, you never feel, forgotten, or neglected.  I can‚Äôt wait to be finished with the place, but that is due to wanting recovery, not getting away from the wonderful people working at PT Solutions. Once recovered, I‚Äôll be sure to drop by just to say hello.  TK"
Very great place. All the workers are encouraging and have a great team work ethic.

This is a great location for physical therapy. The staff helps you set goals and are attentive to your progress/setbacks. Keeps me motivated to get back into sports after ACL reconstruction.
"I just completed 20 weeks of physical therapy as a result of a severe tri-malleolar ankle fracture with dislocation.  My experience at PT Solutions of Douglasville was excellent. The staff, including the therapists, aides, and patient service coordinators, are always courteous, encouraging, and efficient.  I worked mostly with Evan Wohleb and Lisa Landis, and Assante Diaz primarily coordinated my therapy with my physician Dr. Danielle Green-Watson.  Evan and Lisa were wonderful to work with, and they listened to my concerns and worked to overcome my weaknesses.  I also found Assante‚Äôs communication and coordination with my doctor extremely beneficial.  When I came to PT Solutions I was unable to bear weight on my right foot and, I‚Äôd course, could not walk. After complaining therapy I am walking and continually gaining strength.  I am very thankful for PT Solutions, and I highly recommend them for all physical therapy needs."

great place for recovery!
They all serve distinct purpose and work together as a team balanced assessment each day formative. I rate them excellent.
"I am a 78 year old senior who has a severe balance problem and was referred to this clinic by my neurologist.  I had never been to a physical
therapy clinic before and I was somewhat nervous about the visit. I
was blessed to have met such genuine caring people who put me at
ease about what to expect, confidence in my ability to perform the
physical requirements of the treatment program.

I would recommend this practice to anyone who may share the concerns
I had about physical therapy. The entire staff here is very knowledgeable
and professional."
Always pushing people to get better and a great staff teamüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
"Assante, Jon, Lisa took great care of me over the year and a half i spent in and out of therapy up until my surgery and then are doing a spectacular job again helping me regain everything that i lost from the surgery"

This is the best place to go to its really fun
"I was happy to find a physical therapy location that had professional and friendly staff!  Evan, Assante, and Lisa have been so helpful during my recovery process.  I've had low back pain for a while and they were able to assess the issue quickly and develop an adequate therapy program for me.  Janesha and Bailey are also super helpful!  I highly recommended  PT Solutions of Douglasville for your physical therapy needs!"
"I highly recommend PT solutions in Douglasville Ga. not just because of the exceptional care you get but because of the level of professionalism and positivity within the clinic. I am a professional tennis player and have played at the highest level nationally, internationally, and collegiately. I have used PT solutions for my tennis related injuries for eight years now and each time they have helped me return to the court stronger and more confident.
What I‚Äôve really enjoyed about this clinic (as stated above) is the level of professionalism I‚Äôve seen working with Dr. Assante, Dr. Dylan, Dr. Evan, Dr. Lisa, and all the other therapists I‚Äôve worked with throughout the years. They are very good at communicating, encouraging, and pushing you in your exercises. Understandably, this is very important not just for athletes but for everyone who does therapy.
Another positive aspect of this clinic is that they see a variety of different patients including kids, older adults, athletes, etc.
Therefore, if you are looking for a really good physical therapy experience, I would HIGHLY recommend this clinic. Words cannot express how appreciative I am for them. With their help I was able to reach the number 1 national ranked spot in the girls 18 and under division, earn a D1 scholarship to the University of Alabama, and win 3 women‚Äôs professional titles. They keep me going on the court and there is no other place I would prefer over them! Hope you give it a try!"
Awesome experience. No complaints!
Definitely recommend ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Best progress ever and They are very nice and funny üòÅ

"I had a good experience here the past several weeks. I learned some great strategies and exercises to manage my carpal tunnel-like tingling and weakness (which I learned originate from incorrect posture and neck curvature). I primarily worked with Assante, Evan, Baylee, and Janesha. They are all good at giving you a thorough workout. They show that they care by talking with you through the experience, not only about exercise but also to get to know you better.
These workouts are definitely intense, but you'll feel good afterwards. They also give you an exercise plan for home. I have noticed less tingling, better posture, and more strength since I started PT. Finally, the atmosphere is approachable and positive, with inspirational quotes on the walls, friendly staff, and even the ability to request your own music. Highly recommend this clinic."
"Great PT office.  Clean, organized, and great staff.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I spend most of my hour waiting for the PT to give instructions.  This is a little frustrating.  However, I'd rather deal with that and have good therapy then risk going somewhere else."
"The doctors are awesome! They listen to me, and encourage me. Dr. Diaz, Dr. Wohleb, Lisa, Baylee, Janesha, Ornella and Ashya are an awesome team and they take great care of their patients."
The Drs at PT solutions are very professional they listen to all my concerns and I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs Therapy!
"I love it here, the staff is very friendly and makes you feel comfortable"
I loved the way they helped me and treated me. They were extremely nice. I so glad i got help from them and i would definately come back/ recommed someone to come. Dr. Diaz was Great!
"Ornella is an excellent office administrator, and y'all would be very wise to promote her and/or give her a raise.  good administrators will be key to your practise future successes.  Ornella is very professional and courteous too.

Janesha & Baylee were especially helpful in my gaining significant improvement after my total knee replacement surgery,  I didn't have that much interaction with Lisa as I did with the other techs, but she was always kind, courteous, and helpful.

Drs. Wohleb & Diaz were both very kind & professional and so helpful in my gaining significant improvement after my total knee replacement, and I'm looking forward to the same on my lower back too.

All in all, I am very fortunate to have been referred to this excellent practice by Dr. Eric Furie, Atlanta Medical Center.

Thank y'all so very much !!!

John R. Stockwell, MD, MPH, FACPM"
The staff is outstanding.  Lisa and Dr. Diaz have made my recovery possible. Thanks guys.

"I‚Äôve been coming here for four months following shoulder surgery. Dr. Diaz explained my treatment plan and encouraged me to set obtainable goals that I‚Äôm getting closer to every day. He also took the time to construct a comprehensive plan for me to work on at home. Baylee and Janesha always make sure I have what I need and offer support and encouragement, while Evan and Lisa push me to give a little more. Call Ornella or Ashya to schedule an appointment. I‚Äôm glad that I did."
"PT solutions  is really helping me, friendly people and didn‚Äôt make me feel intimidated  had the ability even when you were in pain and make you want to complete your workout push forward and keep trying.

"Life altering experience. This group is amazing!  Friendly, compassionate, and incredibly knowledgeable."
"I have been coming to PT solutions for about two months now. When I tell you I feel soo much better, I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I am now able to do things that I couldn‚Äôt even do before & I just feel great overall. My pcp recommended this place and I‚Äôm glad he did. The staff is super friendly and very nice. Mr. Diaz & Evan have both taken very good care of me. I‚Äôll go in tired sometimes and Mr. Diaz will just brighten up my day. I feel bittersweet knowing therapy is slowly coming to an end."
I have been coming for about 2 weeks now to work on my knee and they have been great!
"This is Pete Demkow not Debbie, I am using my wife's gmail account.  I am finishing up 3 months of treatment at PT solution in Douglasville, GA.   I could not be more satisfied with every aspect of the operation and staff at PT Solutions in Douglasville.  When you walk in the door everyone greets you by name with sincerity.  You feel like a celebrity when I walk in the door.  I cannot find one negative thing to say about the facility or the Douglasville team.

The front desk staff, Ashya and Ornella are friendly and efficient.  They  made numerous changes to my appointments and worked through my insurance challenges, always with the attitude of taking care of me.   I was treated by Dr. Diaz,  Dr. Wohleb, and the assistants Janesha and Baylee.  I did not get to work with Lisa this time, however have worked with her previously and she is great.  Dr. Diaz did my initial assessment and I appreciated him taking the time to ask, listen and explain by treatment plan.  Most of my session were with Dr. Wohleb.  He challenged me to perform each event to the best of my ability.  He pushed me while making sure I was not exceeding my limitations.   He listened to me and encouraged feed back.  Janesha and Baylee kept my sessions moving, they were great at demonstrating exercises, always ready to start the next event and made the  sessions fun.  I did not get to work with Lisa on this injury, however I have worked with her with an previous injury and she is wonderful.

I few things I observed that go towards to leadership and culture of this team.  I never heard a negative word nor  any office chatter between the team members.  The team was  always focused on the patient and not themselves. They all seem to enjoy working at PT Solutions and it is reelected in there attitudes.  I was also impressed with the continuity of treatment.  I worked with 3 different Physical Therapist and each time the treatment never digressed it was always moving forwards which is a reflection on timely and effective patient notes and treatment plans.

I will continue to recommend PT solutions to anyone who needs Physical Therapy.  I cannot say enough about this team and their commitment to taking care of the patient.

Sincerely
Pete Demkow"
All of the staff are encouraging and make the healing process fast and fun
"Had meniscus knee surgery  April 17, 2019. Could not walk, needed theraphy, all physical therapy office were booked. The doctor's office told me to try PT Solutions. Oh my God...best decision made.

Really cool place
"PT Solutions is one of the best in Douglasville. I have been to others in the past and they don't stand up to PT. The therapist take time with you and explain what they are doing and why. Everybody works together to insure you get the best care possible. Thank You PT Solutions, I'm on my way to a better quality of life!"
"My experience at PT solutions has always been awesome. The whole staff is professional and knowledgeable  of any question i might have. Lisa,John, Dr Assante ,Janesha,  Bailey, Ornella and  Ashya are all amazing . I  recommend PT Solutions to all my  friends."
PT Solutions focuses on healing and strengthening their patients to enable them to come back from an injury stronger than before. You can tell that they care about their patients l and want them to get healthy.
10/10 best place for any injury.
PT solutions has great therapists. They offer a wide range of appt times and are able to accommodate our schedule. I was so relieved to find a PT that accepted our insurance and worked with children. They have patients of all ages and treat everyone of them with compassion and concern.
Loved all the staff. They helped my two year old after her hip dysplasia surgery. They let her be a two year old but showed me how to help build up her muscles through play. I think she would go there every day to play with her friends if she could. When she sees a brick building she still calls out their names.
"PT Solutions offer good quality service.  All of the staff here does a wonderful job, and they are so accomodating.  They show patients genuine care.  If you are in need of physical therapy, give PT Solutions of Douglasville a call, and you will not regret it."
"Being a veteran, who has been through PT at many different places, I must say that PT Solutions is the VERY BEST! Semper Fi."
"""Great staff , and I highly recommend this place"""

Love this place! Super friendly and helped me a lot more than other therapists! I would recommend this place!
"I went to Benchmark for a shoulder injury and it was really, really great! Every single member of the staff from the front desk to Bryan dk the rest of the staff were always kind and knowledgeable. My shoulder is back to 100% thanks to them. It‚Äôs definitely the only place I will go to for PT from this point on. Thank you all!!"
"I love the staff at BenchMark PT on Sixes Road!  I had rotator cuff and bicep tear surgery in February of this year and have been going to this location since March 9th.  I have made amazing progress, and close to the end of my therapy.   I could not have made such progress without the team at BenchMark.  Everyone there is like family to me, and I will miss them when I finish my PT.  I highly recommend this location, should you ever need physical therapy."
"This place is amazingüíï
Best staff! They treat you like familyü•∞
I can't thank y'all enoughüíïüíïüíï"
Staff was wonderful! The therapists were extremely knowledgeable. They knew exactly what exercises I needed for strengthening. I would recommend Sixes Road Benchmark to anyone needing these services.
"The perfect place if you're looking for a convenient location, an intimate, comfortable and relaxed atmosphere, and a friendly staff! Bryn, Bree, and the rest of the staff are always so nice and make the overall experience pleasant. Highly recommend!"
"I have been to at least five different PT places and this is the first one I actually looked forward to going to!  The staff is so friendly, it‚Äôs almost like family, especially Bryn & Bree. They were such a pleasure to be around, but all of the staff were great!  My care there was the best I've ever received at a PT place. Bryn and the other therapist there were so knowledgeable, they got me fixed up in no time!

I‚Äôm sad I‚Äôm finished with my treatment, I will miss them!
I would absolutely recommend them to anyone that needs some PT."
"Very Friendly
Very friendly and knowledgeable. Worked with me and listened to my concerns. I have recommended them to friends."
"Very Friendly
Very friendly, listened and gave me practical advice. Very helpful and I feel much better."
"Bryn, Bree and Yvette are incredible to work with. Theyre incredibly welcoming to everyone who comes in and were very attentive when working with the clients. This was my first experience with physical therapy and im thankful for the group at this location because they made recovery very easy for me."
Bryn is fantastic. I had knee surgery and the recovery was harder than I thought. But Bryn was great at listening to what I was experiencing and letting my body decide what it can handle. He really seeks to understand and gain agreement on treatments rather than just follow a script. He even treated my wife‚Äôs neck injury. We both loved the direct treatment and the intestinal time he spends with you. The highly recommend the Benchmark team over on Sixes Rd.
You have a wonderful team working there.  The atmosphere is great and I am so happy with my results.  The therapists that worked with me were very good and discussed my treatment plan on a regular basis.  The whole team exceeded my expectations.
"The therapists at this location are all very good and considerate of the patients needs and comfort. Also fun to do your therapy with,  great group of people. Would recommend if you need physical therapy check them out."
"This is Pete Damon. The BenchMark Physical Therapy facility on Sixes Road in Canton, GA is an exceptional facility to do any PT at. The crew at this facility are all very professional, polite and extremely caring. I cannot rate this facility high enough. Although I sometimes challenged this group, they always had my best interest at heart. Thank you Bryn and Bre for making my experience a pleasure.

Pete Damon"
I would like to thank you for everything. Everyone there was very friendly and professional. Thanks Bryn for taking best care of me and making it fun. I wish you guys  the best.
I have been to physical therapy 6 times for different reasons. Going to the benchmark on Sixes road is the best experience I have ever had and I also did get better. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. The physical therapist that I had was Bren (not sure of spelling).
"This place is awesome. My therapist Matt was great, explained everything in a way I could understand.
All the staff there are very friendly. Place is super clean."
"Brynn and Bree are awesome!!! They are very personable and friendly. Brynn worked with me to help strengthen my ankle after I got hurt at work. And he took his time with me and other patients. If there was more than 1 patient in the clinic, he made sure to spend time with each of us and not make us feel like we were just a number. Bree is super sweet and always has a great attitude. She always made sure that she checked in patients and got their temperatures, and checked out patients leaving and made sure that the facility was clean and stayed within the guidelines for Covid.
Overall, 10/10 HIGHLY recommend!!!"
"BRE is a great asset to benchmark she greets patients with concern on how they are feeling alone with with the pain level their in on the day.she make you feel very comfortable when you walk in the door..

Bryn has the magic touch.i was in accident and was referred to benchmark where I became a patients and met Brynn he's personable and concerning about ones health and will explain the process as he go . I could hardly walk or bend, in a lot of back pain as well.. Bryn has restored my body to some normalcy to where I can do some of my daily activities."
Yvette gave me a more thorough explanation of what was going on with my injury than I have had a from any other PT for other injuries that I have had. She also walked me through several PT exercises to implement right away to put me on the road to a great recovery.
I had the best experience with Bryn and Bree. Started going to PT for a shoulder injury and now my shoulder feels amazing. Everytime I walked in I was greeted by both Bryn and Bree and asked how I was feeling. If Bryn was ever with another patient Bree was right there to step in. You definitely develop a relationship with them. I want to thank both of you for making each visit memorable and entertaining. Was pretty sad today leaving because of how close you get with them. I highly recommend benchmark on sixes road to anyone looking for PT. Couldn't ask for better. Thank you.
I hurt my back and my goal was to heal and get back to what I love doing which is tennis. I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôm back to doing what I love and also stronger for having seen Brynn. I can‚Äôt brag on this place enough. Brynn and Bree are so welcoming and just down the earth people. Bree is always fun to talk to and was willing to help with any questions I had while Brynn was working with other patients. Brynn truly listens and took time to work with me at every appointment. I will actually miss them since we saw each other so frequently. If I ever have any other problems Brynn will be the first person I call. Thank you both again for all your help. Brooke
"Legends

Helped me get back to where I needed to be in no time at all - every therapist there is great"
"I would like to thank you for everything. You and your team‚Äôs knowledge and, specially your charisma, have made me feel very comfortable and welcoming."
You did a great job. Taking care to work on each persons needs.  Knowing and understanding about each person is a real chore and you have it down pat. Wonderful experience
The therapy I received for balance and my low back pain greatly benefited me. I feel more comfortable with my body as I used to lose my balance on occasion. I'm very satisfied with my therapist (Bryn) and now it is up to me to take what I've learned and continue to improve.
"Bryn is an excellent physical therapist and helped me get back to normal after a full knee replacement.  He has a great personality and made the experience enjoyable.  Breanna, at the desk, is always upbeat and extremely helpful.  I highly recommend this facility!"
The team creates a very welcoming atmosphere and gives u all the tools to succeed and they work with u every step of the way highly recommend
"Bryn Cloer, DPT is so knowledgeable and offers a personalized approach to physical therapy that I've not previously experienced. Benchmark was great about truly assessing my back injury not only before treatment, but also assessing my progress during and after treatment. Benchmark innovates new physical therapy techniques and makes use of common objects and infrastructure (for example, a door frame). This makes it easy to translate your treatment to a home approach and continue while you are out of the office. For a holistic approach to physical therapy not just focusing on an injury, but on you as whole individual, Benchmark is a great option."
Bryn and Breanna are amazing. Thanks to them my recovery has been great. Highly recommend them!
"Great experience for my first PT.  Dr, staff were excellent, professional and i looked forward to coming to my appt.  After about 6 weeks, I am better than new.  Love this place.  Thanks Bryn and staff for taking best care of me and making it fun"
This is the place to go to get help!
Everyone there was very friendly and professional.  I felt they were most concerned about me and my issues.  Would recommend this physical therapy location to everyone.
I came here in the beginning of January with a bad meniscus injury involving a high contact/physical sport. They helped me get well as soon as possible even though it may have took awhile I‚Äôm now cleared a month early. Thank you Benchmark!!
"When I first came in to BenchMark, the severe pain in my hip was getting worse, but by the time my therapy ended, the outstanding attention given by Bryn and Bre made me feel really good again. My problem was targeted, treated with care, and compassion. I highly recommend BenchMark for physical therapy because they make you feel like family, and I will miss them!"
"This place is great! Amazing staff, really helped me with a sports injury- I‚Äôm beyond grateful. Thank you so much!"
Bryn Cloer is an excellent PT.  The ‚Äúoffice‚Äù is Immaculate!  He really helped me gain mobility and strength!  I would highly recommend Bryn and Sixes Benchmark!
"I had knee replacement surgery in late June this year.  I had my PT at Benchmark on Sixes Rd, in Canton GA.  I highly recommend Bren and his staff, they were so helpful, so careful, made sure I had treatment that met my needs without causing me additional pain. I am very satsified with the therapy and the staff at Benchmark Sixes Rd Canton GA"
"Bryn was the BEST PT I have ever had! His techniques were exactly what I needed to heal my ankle injury and get me back to my regular routine.

The Sixes Rd. location was conveniently located next to the highway and the facilities were very clean and professional.

I will ALWAYS recommend my friends and family to see Bryn if they ever have an injury needing PT.

Thank you Bryn for all your help in getting me back to the grind!!!!"
"Bryn was great to have as a PT. Would definitely recommend to anyone to use this team, their a great help!"
I felt like they always were looking out for my recovery and safety. Teaching me exercises I could and should use daily and why. You guys were really very good at your jobs Thank You!

It is a great place. Great staff ensure you are on the road to recovery. Only complaint I could make is the place it getting outdated. Currently utilizing aquatic therapy and I can tell a difference.
"The experience is professional but not at all friendly, I guess because I have only been in for about almost 2 months. When asking legitmate questions the therapist seems annoyed and answers with  an insolent or condescending answer with a very Pretentious smile.I am a polite individual and although I  ignore people‚Äôs behavior it could be quite disheartening watching how people react when working with you as though they just don‚Äôt want to work with you I could be having a bad day, . But I‚Äôm fine , I can deal with it"


"This Benchmark Physical Therapy location has been a wonderful experience for me. Everybody who works there has shown me great care and professionalism. Shannon Bowling helped me tremendously when I broke my arm and then a few months later when I strained my hip. When she moved, John Funnell replaced her and has worked with me to complete the therapy for my hip. He is great! Very kind, compassionate, and extremely knowledgeable. Courtney and Sean and Anna have also been so nice and have made my whole experience very positive. I can recommend them very highly to anyone who needs physical therapy help. Thank you to all of them!"
"I had a great experience at Benchmark Physical Therapy! I'm student-athlete who was struggling with some knee and hip pain while playing basketball. After trying out different physical therapies, I came to Benchmark. Mrs. Courtney and I tried out different exercises and used the ones that worked best and after a few weeks of doing these exercises I saw lots of improvement in my hips and knees. Now, I don't struggle with the pain I used to have playing! I definitely recommend coming here."
"I have completed my care at BenchMark on Windward Parkway.  My provider was Courtney!  She is amazing!  She was very attentive to my needs, asked good questions, answered all my concerns, and provided excellent recommendations!    Hopefully, I will not need to have care again, but if I do, I'll request her specifically.  The team, as well, was very professional, accommodating and made my visits welcoming!  Highly recommend!"
"The entire Benchmark team at Alpharetta-Windward Parkway was awesome! Everyone was friendly and knowledgeable. Not too many people can say they enjoy going to therapy, but I looked forward to going to each appointment. I feel great and can move around with ease.  Thank you!"
"An excellent experience with this Benchmark location helping me with Plantar Fasciitis in both feet!   I struggled with my feet and procrastinated probably too long before seeking treatment, but Shannon at this location patiently and professionally got me back on the path of pain free walking and standing.   Everyone in this facility is super friendly and seem pleased to see you during each visit and displayed an amazing ability to remember your history..   I highly recommend Benchmark for any Physical Therapy needs you may have!  I feel extremely lucky to have found them."
"The attention showed for your specific work-out is exceptional!!! Thank you sooo much for your help! My arm has come a looong way! Shannon is an amazing God sent!!

- Catherine Hooks."
"My experience with Courtney at BenchMark Physycal Therapy was very successful. I had a SI joint and hip pain. Courtney took great care of me. During each session, she asked the right questions which allowed her to adapt the treatment and exercises she would give. It enabled me to get back to a solid routine pre and post run. I strongly recommend the BenchMark Physical Therapy team located at the Windward facilities."
Really cured the pain in my in my upper arm. Highly recommended
"I started with Benchmark in March of last year. I am going on almost 1 year with Pavel Gorokhov and Kellyann. I am delighted to say my experience with my Physical Therapist has been the best. I will refer anyone to Pavel over at Benchmark in Alpharetta. Pavel. I am almost finish with my Physical Therapy. I am going to miss you and Kellyann. I look forward to seeing you guys every week, you have became a part of me like family, my leaving will be bitter sweet, but I know, I can‚Äôt stay forever. I looked forward to Kellyann beautiful smile, telling me how happy she is to see me. I will miss Pavel pushing me to my limits, telling me I can do this.
I will miss him saying to his patients, when we are there on a Wednesday, asking us, what day is it guys( he always says it‚Äôs Friday). He knows how to make us laugh, even when we are in pain, and trying our hardest. Pavel, you and Kellyann are my rock. I love you guys for all the great laughs, and always making my day so bright, even on a rainy day.... from my heart to you all. I will miss you guys! You are the best. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"My experience was wonderful at BenchMark Physical Therapy on Windward Parkway in Alpharetta, GA. Shannon Bowling helped me enormously. I had a broken arm and was unable to move it. Shannon helped me get back my mobility, strength, and range of motion. She is so caring and understanding, and has a wonderful personality. She really knows what she's doing! I would HIGHLY recommend her and this location to anyone who needs physical therapy. In addition, the place was extremely clean, had a very pleasant atmosphere, and everybody was very friendly and courteous. Anna at the front desk was very sweet and helpful. A few months later I had a problem with my hips and again I was helped tremendously by Shannon and by John Funnell towards the end of my therapy. It's a great place. I highly recommend it!"
I changed to benchmark from another company and glad I did courtney was great at helping my arm
"My wife broke her wrist and was referred to Linda Clinton, a hand specialist.  Linda and her associates did a great job of getting my wife back to the point where she could function normally.  The staff was kind, courteous, and very empathetic.  I would recommend Linda and Benchmark for your PT needs.  I've been to other Benchmark locations for back and wrist problems and have been equally satisfied."
"I was in terrible pain on right frozen shoulder which make my day to day work much harder to do.

Thanks you so much to Shannon for all your support and guidance for the past 2 to 3 months for my right frozen shoulder pain.

I am much better now than I was when I joined PT.

All credits go to Shannon  for getting me back to normal.

I recommend anyone who has same problem to Benchmark PT.

Regards
Rohit Davey"
My doctor referred me to this clinic for physical therapy for a broken ankle. The therapists were friendly and professional. I felt my recovery was certainly expedited because of my visits there. Highly suggest!
"Everyone is exceptionally nice at this Bench Mark's facility! Virginia and Corey made sure my ankle and leg muscles were worked and stretched to get it back to normal.  I am very thankful to Virginia, that she gave me insights on how muscles work in tandem to each other and how Dry Needling can solve some of the issues. My recovery was fast once Virginia started dry needling along with Corey's strengthening exercises. It took me 3 months to heal 100% from injury which was impacting my daily life from last 2-3 years. I appreciate them very much and highly recommend anyone to go see them."
"Great place for your rehab! I been working with this team for several months. The PT‚Äòs are really dedicated and overall just a really friendly team. I highly recommend COREY - he‚Äôs been my main PT from the beginning. I been battling this annoying, chronic hamstring injury for years, however it‚Äôs the first time that I feel like somebody really helps me to get finally rid of this condition. The dedication, creativity and effort he‚Äôs putting in on a weekly basis, is something I‚Äôve never seen in PT before. To me he almost feels like my personal coach! Every week he comes up with new exercises and is a great motivator. I also recommend his colleague Virginia, who‚Äôs doing a great job with dry needling."
I had a fantastic experience at this location! I was having chronic migraines that prevented me from doing my best at work. Virginia knew exactly what to do to relieve my pain and several weeks later I am very happy to be migraine free! The staff here is wonderful and they are 100% invested in your recovery. I highly recommend Virginia and am so thankful for her help!
"A wonderful facility with a fun, caring staff.  Virginia Hogan is terrific - she worked to heal me over a period of three months with great results.  She is insightful and has great people skills as well.  Kevin assists Virginia and other PT's and is great as well.  I would highly recommend this branch of Benchmark PT and Virginia & Kevin."
I highly recommend this facility.  Virginia Hogan is an excellent physical therapist.  She listened to all my concerns and was able to get me full range of motion back in my shoulder after surgery.  The staff if very friendly and professional.  They have a great team at BenchMark Windward.
"DISGUSTING AND HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I called and took appointment and what I was told is w/o doctors prescription, i can go up to 8 visits or 3 weeks( which ever comes 1st). They wasted my good 1.5 hrs of time on a working day.The front desk service wasn't great and they made me sit for 15-20 mins to fill all the forms and after some time they said we have a fresh grad and he needs doctors prescription to treat me. I told them that's not what I was said during the phone conversation when I booked the appointment, but they stick to their point and not ready to listen to me. Most horrible experience. I need to wait for 2 weeks to get this appointment and end of the day no treatment. Please stay away from this horrible and unprofessional facility."
Everyone is exceptionally nice! Virginia and Kevin made sure my knee was worked and stretched to get it back to normal. I appreciate them very much and highly recommend anyone to go see them.
"Excellent staff, very friendly.  I had a total knee replacement and they did a great job of ""fixing me up"" - I give them as much credit as my surgeon for my very successful outcome.  Ashton Fannin and Kevin worked me hard over an 8 week period and it was well worth it."
"This was my first time going to PT, and I am so glad I came here. Peter is so great! Very professional, knowledgable, and friendly. I think this is a new clinic so it was super clean and nice. I would definitely recommend this location and Peter!"
"After having a bad experience at another physical therapy location my doctor and I selected Benchmark, and I cannot express words on how pleasant their staff was during my short time with them. When I first arrived at this office, I was terrified, but they quickly put my nerves to rest and showed me what a real positive experience should have looked been from the start. They were confident, encouraging, kind, and worked well with my single mother schedule. I would recommend them to anyone who is suffering from pain or in need of Physical Therapy."
Came to see Peter to help my dad function better after his stroke.  Peter helped my dad reduce the amount of falls he was having. My dad went from barely walking using a rolling walker to being able to walk with a cane. Highly recommend Peter!
"I strained a thigh muscle while riding my bike. Peter used a technique called dry needling to relieve my muscular pain by getting rid of all the knots. It really help a LOT and the pain was gone in no time! Peter is very knowledgeable, friendly and most importantly took the time to educate me about how I might have gotten the injury and how to prevent it from happening again in the future. I highly recommend Peter's skill and expertise!"
"Peter is Awsome!  I have been to many PT's over the years and he is wonderful!
He reviewed my medical history thoroughly, listened to my input and has catered my care accordingly.
He is also great at dry needing!"
"This was first experience with PT. I was having severe neck pain and my doctor suggested to have PT. I found this place on google maps near to my place. My therapist was Virginia Hogan, she helped me reduce my pain. After 6 weeks, there is no pain. I would highly recommend her and this location."
Went in with severe back pain and couldn't move my back! Peter Park helped restore my motion and eliminate my pain quickly! Highly recommended!
"I came here with back pain.  Now, I am off pain meds and learn a few tricks to keep my pain in check.  Look for Peter and Hanz.  They are very early risers."
I‚Äôm so glad I chose physical therapy after my car accident. The staff here was very professional and generally cared about my recovery process. It was a process but the team here helped me every step of the way.
Very unfriendly and unhelpful staff.





This staff here is friendly and knowledgeable - we are always satisfied with the quality of care we receive. Greg has seen my wife on many occasions for her chronic back issues - she always comes away feeling better and with new exercises to improve her back health.  The facility is always clean and organized. Highly recommend this facility and Greg Woodard.
Only 2 days after a pretty significant shoulder surgery I was here for PT. I was a little nervous not knowing what to expect but it turned out to be just fine. Dr. (Greg) Woodward worked on my shoulder for several months and gained my trust right from the start. Everyone there is great and I highly recommend them if you should ever find yourself in need of physical therapy. Thanks guys!
Wonderful experience! I've been dealing with back pain for several years. Greg was terrific working around my work schedule and through weeks of his instruction I have now gained my mobility back. The staff are professional and eager to assist. The facility and equipment are clean and well-maintained. I would highly recommend PT Solutions of Canton West.
"I came here after rotator cuff surgery and was a little nervous about what to expect.  The staff was very encouraging, professional , friendly  and knowledgeable.  I was very happy with the care that I received and would, without any hesitation,  recommend this facility to anyone looking for physical therapy."
Greg has the best personality and always makes you feel invited. He cares for all of his patients and makes sure they always have the best care.
I saw Dr. Luke for my low back pain I was experiencing for 8 months. I had tried other PT places and I did not see any improvement and was beginning to think it would never get better. I saw Luke for 3-4 weeks and noticed a huge improvement and I was able to be mostly pain-free and return to things   I enjoy. He was very knowledgeable and friendly and made PT fun for me. I actually enjoyed going! I would highly recommend!
I had a wonderful experience at this establishment. I have been going to PT for several months now after my car accident. Greg and Fallan were both so consistent in trying to get my back to feel better. I am very thankful for them and this place as a whole for being great and proactive in getting me where I should be. Can‚Äôt thank them enough!
The facility is amazing and the staff is very thorough and knowledgeable. Greg is a wonderful physical therapist and I truly feel like he cares about my health and well being. As a nurse and avid hiker my ability to use my body without pain and discomfort is really important and I fully trust the staff to help me meet my goals.
Just wanted to share my thoughts. Gabriella has been my therapist for eight weeks now. She is an incredibly knowledgeable Therapist. I highly recommend PT solutions and hopefully you will be lucky enough to get Gabby. Thanks Gabby.
My back is feeling so much better! Highly recommend!
"Staff was not very nice, did not make for a comfortable 3 times a week for 3 weeks recovery.  I will never go back."
"I am a softball player recovering from MDI, which is a shoulder injury. The staff here pushed me to do my best and reminded me of what i‚Äôm working towards. I am so grateful to PT Solutions for getting me back on the field."
"I completed therapy today after rotator cuff surgery. I can‚Äôt say enough about the good results and great care I‚Äôve received! Dr. Luke is very knowledgeable and really cares about his patients. He‚Äôs encouraging and gives you the tools and information you need to progress in the clinic and at home. The entire staff is a pleasure to interact with, and they‚Äôre taking all precautions to keep their patients safe during this pandemic. I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else for PT!"
"If you are an aging athlete in need of effective rehab to optimize your return to normal activity, then you have found the right place. Daniel, with a PHD,  is the most competent physical therapists I have ever met. The receptionist James, is one of the most caring individuals I have ever met in Canton. I cannot adequately describe how wonderful the remaining staff members are.  They have the latest equipment, the place is spotless, I could go on and on, but if you live in the Canton area, don't go anywhere until you check them out.  I have an undergraduate degree in Physical Education and an Army Ranger.  I think I know a bit in sharing with you that this PT & Sports Rehab establishment is FIRST CLASS!!!!!"
"I graduated from Canton Physical Therapy today.  Dr. Luke is very knowledgeable, caring and great to work with.  The entire staff is friendly, I will miss going there.  Cathy M"
"Daniel and his amazing staff at Canton Physical Therapy and Sports Rehabilitation went above and beyond in helping with my recovery from ankle surgery. And, thanks to them, I now feel fully healed and confident in my return to ballet.
I was very impressed with how incredibly proffesional yet fun it was to work with this fantastic physical therapy group. All exercises and therapy was personalized to fit my precise needs, and I have made so much progress in such a short amount of time.
In addition to my own experience, I noticed how versatile the therapists were with all ages and skill levels. As there were many other people, like me, returning to sports after injuries and surgeries as well as people who were simply in need of a regimen to help with day to day life.
As a result I would strongly suggest this highly sophisticated PT to anyone in the area."
"My over all experiences have been very positive. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. James is very flexable with times and days that will fit your schedule for appointments. Judy evaluated me at my first appointment and then planed a program based on my need, starting at my level and adding to the routine as I improved. Judy also provided the different bands that I need, and a printout of the stretches so I can do them at home daily. You make better progress when done daily not just on days you go for PT! Patients take priority with the whole staff, who are compassionate, skilled and knowledgeable. I have had traction for back pain, and wonderful massage, dry needling for my shoulder, plus a lot of the other TLC they offer. I am confident that you will not be disappointed with their professional services. I highly recommend Canton Physical Therapy & Sports Rehabilitation. They are the best!!"
"I would like to highly recommend Canton Physical therapy. I have been going there for two weeks to help with my Plantar Faciitis. Special call out to my therapist Luke Siegmann. He is very knowledgeable, professional, courteous, personable and friendly. UPDATE. Luke was able to cure my Plantar Faciitis and heel pain within less than 3 months. I went to see him twice a week and performed the home exercises he gave me. I was so worried I would need surgery when we first started and was so relieved when the pain went away. Thank you  Luke."
"My Orthopedic Surgeon highly recommended this group, and I am so glad he did!  From the very first visit  with Daniel, I knew I was in the right place. The level of knowledge, professionalism, concern and care for their patients  is phenomenal.  The entire staff works together as a team to ensure that you receive therapy specific to your needs.
I would highly recommend Canton Physical Therapy & Sports Rehabilitation to anyone needing a PT group. They are the best!"
I was very pleased with the help I got to heal my shoulder injury. Excellent staff with attention to details. I love golf and Dr Daniel Tari who looked after me is expert in helping golfers (Titleist Performance Institute Certified). Highly recommend this place.
"I would highly recommend Daniel and his team.  As a very active sports oriented middle aged man I have had my share of sports injuries over the last 15 years (back, shoulder, elbow, and most recently hip).  I have had my share of PT and therapists through the years.  Daniel has proven to be the be the most knowledgeable and comprehensive in approaching exactly what the clinical problem is and tailoring a program specifically to address it.   You will not find a better facility for your rehab needs than Canton Physical Therapy & Sports Rehab!"
"So glad I trusted the Google reviews the Canton PT! Sever back pain the last two days. I called this morning and amazingly was able to get in this afternoon thanks to Judy's willingness to work me in and stay late. Judy was kind, thorough and friendly. Exactly what someone in pain needs. She dry needled multiple areas and provided me with relief! If you haven't tried dry needling, you owe it to yourself to ask about. It's not a well known procedure, but highly effective. And don't let the idea of needles scare you. It not that bad, and likely much less painful that what you are dealing with anyway :)  Thank you so much Judy! See you again soon. Btw, James on the front desk was very kind and empathetic to my situation. Thanks folks!"
"My name is Jim Struck.  I recently had left hip replacement and was able to pursue physical therapy at the Canton Physical Therapy and Sports Rehab facility in Canton, Georgia.  All of my experiences were extremely positive regarding their treatment and attitude of their staff.  I personally worked with Judy and Corey with building of strength and flexibility after my surgery with Dr. Seng.  Complete staff is very friendly and made my overall experience fun as well as productive.  I strongly recommend this facility for any type of rehab, strength building and working on overall flexibility.  Stop by and see them and you will find them very welcoming."
"I am very pleased with this clinic.  I had a torn hip labrum surgically repaired in December and have used Canton P.T. for my rehab.  Daniel is a fantastic therapist.  This type surgery requires a 13 week P.T. plan that has to be handled very slowly and delicately.  Daniel and the staff handled it very well.  I'm just barely past the 3 month period in a 6 month healing process, but I believe Canton P.T. has got me on the right track.  The entire staff, from Judy and Daniel to everyone else, does a great job of working with each patient."
I was referred to Canton Physical Therapy by my Orthopedic doctor for a recurring back injury.  Daniel understood immediately that I had little patience with being incapacitated.  I love being active so together we worked hard and I was back to 100% very quickly. Looking forward  to get ting back into golf this Spring.  Highly recommend Daniel and his staff but remember they can only have success if you are willing to do the work.
"I fractured my hip and severed the femur in December of 2017, started therapy in Rochester, NY, The surgeon said the outlook was bleak to recover full movement.  We were lucky we moved to Canton GA and heard about Canton Physical Therapy and Sports Rehabilitation.  They have been incredible.  They are really concerned about you as the patient and after two months, I am almost back to 100%.  They are the best PT business I have ever worked with.  Strongly recommend them."
Canton PT & Sports Rehab has been my on and off home for the last 3 1/2 years for various injuries and aging body.  They are the greatest.  Judy Rossie runs a tight ship with the best support group ever.  I highly recommend them for any physical therapy you might need
"Canton physical therapy is incredible! Luke was my therapist and he‚Äôs amazing! Luke helped me achieve so much and I am so grateful. I actually learned things about my physiology that will help me for the rest of my life that I never would‚Äôve known had it not been for Luke‚Äôs thorough understanding and explanations. Everyone there is, not just nice but fun and very pleasant to be around.  I was not expecting to enjoy physical therapy but these guys made that a reality. Everyone from James at the front desk to Daniel (the main man) to Luke, Charles, Eli, I never got to know everyones name but every single one of them are an absolute pleasure to do business with. Let‚Äôs face it, nobody wants to be in the position to need physical therapy but if you do, these are the people you wanna be getting that much needed help from. They truly go above and beyond and take care of their patients in a way that is far too rare these days! If you need physical therapy, do yourself a favor and go see these guys and gals, you won‚Äôt be sorry!"
"I am so thankful that I received excellent therapy after my knee replacement surgery. The competent professionals are devoted to patient progress at Canton Physical Therapy and sports rehabilitation. My knee feels great after a few weeks of hard work in the relaxing atmosphere.
Evelyn Hughes"
"I went to see Dr. Tari. After meeting with him the first time, I knew I was in good hands. He was so nice and did such a wonderful job explaining to me how we were going to heal my knee after surgery. He also asked me what my goals were. Of course the first was to get off my crutches but I had always wanted to run a 5k. He worked with me and pushed me hard but I got off of the crutches AND I have since been able to run the 5k distance...just have to sign up for an actual 5k! Seriously, you will be in good hands here!"
"I suffered with debilitating Bursitis in both hips for several years.  I had tried several rounds of cortisone injections and iced regularly with no long term success.  I was considering surgery, but decided to give physical therapy a shot.  Daniel put together a course of stretching and strengthening routines for me.  After two weeks of diligent work at home and their professional treatment over 8 visits, my improvement was phenomenal.  While skeptical in the beginning, I am now a believer that physical therapy with consistent patient follow through can work wonders.   I no longer hobble after sitting for long periods, my balance has improved and I am more physically active than I have been for many years."
This place is amazing! I had 2 hip surgeries in the last 9 months and they did a fantastic job helping get back to 100%
"Daniel Tari, Judy and the entire staff at Canton Physical Therapy make you feel like family as soon as you arrive. After that, they prove themselves to be at the top of their field providing a level of care that is both professional, as well as, compassionate. I have made great progress there after extensive right shoulder surgery and will soon be back in my office adjusting my patients. I know where I will be sending anyone that needs Physical Therapy care."
"Love Canton Physical Therapy. They treated a very painful hamstring pull for me.  I was so impressed with the care and expertise,  from the front (James) to my therapist ( Daniel) to the massage therapist (James). I would highly recommend this practice."
"From the time you schedule your first appointment with James, until the day you are discharged from  the program, the  Physical therapists assess your problem and develop a plan which is shared with the Physical Therapy assistants and their  team .This assures you have continuity and progression towards your goal each and every time you return for a treatment.  Your needs for recovery are their priority.  This  type of commitment  to the patient is rare.  Thanks to all of you.
Linda Ries"
Dr. Tari is awesome! He is very thorough and knowledgeable. He definitely knows how to take care of his patients. The whole staff is so friendly. I would not go anywhere else. Highly recommend.
"I highly recommend canton pt.. their people are skilled and caring! If you don't use these helpful people your missing the boat. they are special!
If you need physical therapy this is the place!"
The therapists here are extremely the best! I highly recommend them. You will be very pleased and happy with your results.
"Daniel and the entire staff are wonderful people who genuinely care about the well being of their patients.  From the moment you enter the facility and are greeted so warmly through your entire workout regimen, the professionalism and compassion of the staff is on display."
"Dr. Tari and his staff are first class.  As a local doctor, I have referred several of my patients to them for additional treatment and they always provide excellent care. They take the time to evaluate and educate every patient on their condition so they can achieve the best results. I would highly recommend them to anyone!"
"They have an awesome environment. They also have a great staff all around. As a college athlete that has suffered multiple injuries, i can honestly say that Canton Physical Therapy is the best practice ive been to."
"As a college athlete who has had a few injuries throughout her career, I came home for Christmas Break and needed to complete rehab during my time home. Daniel was so gracious to work me into his schedule up to 3 days a week. There is no way I would have been ready for season when I got back to school if it were not for CPTR!"
"Pat and I both visited Canton Institute for Physical Therapy in 2011 for frozen shoulder conditions.  After 6-8 visits we were (and still are) totally mobile in our shoulders.
I have had 2 treatment plans (in 2016 and 2017) from my motorcycle accident.  Judy and Daniel are the best!  My torn MCL is completely rehabilitated and I'm back on the ""bike"" ready for our next ride to the Blue Ridge Parkway.
Thanks for a thorough diagnosis and a 100% successful treatment plan!"
I have had physical therapy 2x in the past at other locations. I thought they were OK but Canton Physical Therapy is head and shoulders above them. I highly recommend them.They listened  to me and helped alleviate my concerns. The owners and staff are friendly and caring.
Canton Physical Therapy and Sports Rehabilitation is an excellent clinic.  My experience with Daniel and team was second to none.  Thanks for the help with my herniated disc!
"Dr. Daniel Tari is very knowledgeable about the latest techniques for tennis elbow. I had manual therapy, dry needling, eccentric exercises (which emphasize the negative), and transdermal anti-inflammatory medication. He gave me a good progression of exercises so I can do yoga again.  I highly recommend him! I am definitely coming to this office if I ever need physical therapy again."
"Just first visit but first impressions are that it's a great place with wonderful, friendly staff."
"Canton Physical Therapy is an incredible place to experience complete recovery from knee replacement surgery. Dan Tari, Jess, Kayla and Judy are incredible therapists with a wealth of knowledge and experience in helping people recover from surgeries or injuries.  Can't say enough good things! They got me back and walking pain-free100% in 4 months! Thank you,  Dan and Team!"
"I kept my PT appt. one morning (for my back) even though i still had ""my morning migraine"".  My migraines had been getting worse over the last 3 years and were now daily.

When I walked into Canton PT, I asked Judy Rossi to ""be gentle with me"" because my migraine pill hadn't quite worked.  She asked if I'd like her to work on the migraine.

After checking my neck and some message, she explained what might be causing it and asked if she could ""dry needle"" my neck.  With some trepidation... I said yes.  (I was in a lot of pain by then.)

Well...  that was about 6 weeks ago and I haven't had a single migraine since!!!  The dry needling hurts a little momentarily, but I feel like I have my life back.  Kudos to Judy Rossi and Canton Physical Therapy."
They are the best of the best and offer a wide range of therapies including massage. Cannot say enough about how professional they are and the progress I always make under their care.
"Great PT facility for folks in Canton, Ga.  The staff is very professional and they know what to do.  Could not have recovered from knee surgery without the knowledge and skill of this staff.  Very happy."
"Absolutely Incredible service!!! I injured my knee in a sporting event on a Saturday night and Dr. Tari got me in on Monday morning at 9am. Not only did his staff go above and beyond in aiding my full recovery, they provided a fantastic environment where I actually looked forward to my appointments. Dr. Tari helped me to a speedy, safe recovery and my knee feels better than ever. I cannot say enough great things about the service and professionalism from Dr. Tari and this incredible team. Would highly recommend to anyone!"
The therapists here are the best in this area! Highly recommend! Individualized and competent patient care only!
"Dr. Tari has been and continues to be so amazing! He takes the time to assess the injury, and he educates you about your body. He helped me when I was having migraines and neck pain. Him and his staff are extremely friendly!"
"I started PT with Daniel in mid Aug. In my profession I‚Äôm on my feet for 14/24 hours at a time & my pain level was at a 10!! I felt that I would never feel relief again & felt very discouraged. After 10 visits I‚Äôm amazed and internally grateful for Daniel and his awesome staff especially Yajaira & James!! My pain level is down to a 1 and somedays it‚Äôs at a 0. I can‚Äôt praise Daniel enough for his knowledge, healing powers & continuing to push me towards progress. If you are in need I highly recommend CPTSR!!"
My rheumatologist referred me to Judy Rossi to treat my back pain. He said she was the best physical therapist to help me. I am feeling so much better. No longer need pain medication. Highly recommend!!!
Judy is awesome and very knowledgeable. Front staff is very professional and organized. I recommend this place to anyone.
"Would definitely recommend this clinic to anyone who is looking for a physical therapist.  The office staff were easy to work with, and Dr. Tari was incredibly helpful and informative throughout the whole process, really helped fix my shoulder up!"
Great place full of super friendly people who are there to help you get better.
Knowledgeable competent therapists dedicated to patient full recovery with efficient support staff.   Have used several times - Best in Area
Daniel Tari is a great PT who takes the time to explain the rehab process to you. Highly recommend him
"Daniel Tari - PT, DPT, OCS  worked a miracle on my hip avulsion! The proper exercises to aleviate my pain and increase my mobility was uncanny. I would recommend them to anyone. Judith has MAGIC hands!
Even if your not close it's worth the drive for your health."
Daniel Tari is a great physical therapist and I highly recommend seeing him if you have to rehab an injury or are just trying to improve your fitness!
I can't recommend Canton Physical Therapy and Dr. Tari more highly.  The office staff is friendly and professional.  Dr. Tari took time not only with my therapies but to explain and make sure I understood the entire process.  Dr. Tari truly cares about his patients.
"Went to see Dr. Tari here for a sports injury I have been dealing with.  After making his initial diagnosis of my situation he seemed very confident he could help me.  He did a great job explaining to me in simple terms what was going on with my injury and how we were going to rehab it.  Between the sessions with Dr. Tari and following his instructions for daily stretching and excercise, I have been able to heal my injury.  Their staff is very friendly and professional and they have a nice office with some cool high tech excercise equipment."
Great staff and good people.
Dr. Tari really helped me out with a long standing nagging shoulder problem. Professional and thorough. Highly recommended.
"Daniel, Jess, and Judy are wonderful people who truly care about helping you! I could not recommend a better place."
"Daniel, Judy and the staff are great. Helped me tremendously following major shoulder surgery."
Daniel Goes above and beyond to help me with my illness.  I'm so thankful yup him.
"Dr. Tari is awesome, I highly recommend."
"Fantastic group of professionals, highly recommended."
Dr. Tari is the best!
"(Translated by Google) Hello first something to me:
I am a golfer and I try to make this my job. I have been to Atlanta on vacation for the past three weeks to advance my golf game. Before I came to Atlanta, I also had severe back problems.

I then hooked up with Daniel from Canton Therapy & Sports Rehabilitation and this was exactly what I was looking for.
He showed me where I got weaknesses in my swing, where I got my pain from and what I can do about it.

So I can only recommend it, it costs a little money, but it helps a lot, it's a shame that there are none of them near me in Germany.

Would have liked to continue with him. But then I had to go back again.

(Original)
Hallo erst mal kurz was zu mir:
Ich bin ein Golfspieler und ich versuche dies zu meinen beruf zu machen. Ich war die letzten drei Wochen in Atlanta zum Urlaub machen und  um dort mein Golfspiel voran zubringen. Bevor ich nach Atlanta kam, hatte ich auch starke R√ºckenprobleme.

Ich bin dann mit Daniel von Canton Therapy & Sports Rehabilitation zusammengekommen und dies war genau, was ich gesucht habe.
Er hat mir gezeigt, wo ich schw√§chen in meinem Schwung habe, woher ich meine schmerzen habe und was ich dagegen machen kann.

Also ich kann ihn nur weiter empfehlen, kostet zwar etwas geld, aber hilft viel, Schade das es davon keinen bei mir in der N√§he in Deutschland gibt.

H√§tte da gerne, mit ihn weiter gemacht. Aber habe dann wieder zur√ºck gehen m√ºssen."

"Loved my experience with ATI Suwanee. New location, everything is brand new and the therapists are so attentive. Masks worn the whole time and everything is sanitized right after you touch it. The therapist is so compassionate and makes sure you are comfortable throughout all exercises. They slowly increase intensity with each visit and now I can‚Äôt believe how far I have improved in just 12 visits. Would highly recommend!"
"Minsuk worked with me and was very patient and  very knowledgeable in areas that we discussed.
I do not like PT but I did find it more enjoyable than anywhere else I have ever gone."
"If you‚Äôre looking for a place to begin therapy treatment, look no further. Minsuk, is a wonderful therapist. As well as his assistant, Felipe. Over the past five weeks they ‚Äúworked‚Äù me back to a healthier state. They did not allow me to give up on myself. These guys were very pleasant to work with and accommodating. I enjoyed being their firstüôÇ I‚Äôm gonna miss them asking, ‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù"
I have been through PT several times at other places I absolutely love everything about the experience there The skill the caring the fact that they absolutely know what they're doing and get results I love it
Team was very helpful with my workout injury. I highly recommend them.
"Great service and experience, they took me from my psoas injury in less time than expected and complementary exercises as well"
Takes great care of me. Also has lasting relationships after sessions. They give their full attention to you whenever you come in for a session. Great people but better therapists.
Very friendly




Excellent customer service. Very professional staff. Helped me identifying muscle weakness and areas requiring strength and endurance. I‚Äôm satisfied with my progress!
"I had a great experience with Benchmark  Physical Therapy, the receptionist and the therapist were amazing they make you feel so comfortable and both were very professional, I recommend that Physical therapy to everyone!"
"My experience from beginning to end was wonderful,  I almost hated being done with my treatment."
My personal experience with PT at Benchmark Physical Therapy was a wonderful experience.  The sessions for my neck was worked very well.  Now that I have completed that section of my PT  I am going to finish up with PT on my back.  Howard Layton
"I have been to many Benchmarks over the years for multiple injuries. The employees are always welcoming and this Benchmark is no different. The clinic atmosphere is pleasant and is kept very clean. The office coordinator and the therapist are easy to talk to and put your concerns at ease. If you need a physical therapist, I highly recommend going to Kelsey Mims at the Centerville clinic."
"Cara at the front desk is wonderful, she always offer excellent service with a smile, and a joy to be around. Kelsey is a phenomenal therapist. My first time going to physical therapy for my chronic pain was about 6 to 7 weeks. She helped me and given me the tools there to utilize at home to stay on track through my condition. After experiencing other medical issues, I was referred back to a physical therapist and I told my doctor that I wanted to be referred back to BenchMark because Kelsey cares about her patients and she really pushes us to recovery. Prior to BenchMark, my health condition kept me down and because of Kelsey, I am able to be more active and thrive at work."

Top notch  Physical therapy. They have really helped me with my left shoulder. Very clean and organized. Both Andrew's are great. Highly recommend.
"Everyone on the team in Villa Rica has been fantastic on my Physical Therapy journey.  Andrew helped me tremendously, and I would recommend him to anyone who needs physical therapy."
"I finished my physical therapy last week! Andrew, Rachel and the staff are great! Andrew is very knowledgeable and got me where I needed to be. I would strongly recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy in Villa Rica!"
Just completed my therapy here andrew was great to work with. He pushed you to make yourself better but at the same time he did it at pace that fit you. I recommend anyone needing therapy go see Andrew. Rachel is also amazing at the front desk especially when you don't remember your appointment that day. Just a great group of people.
I am very happy with the therapy I received at Benchmark.  Andrew was my therapist and he was great.  He was very professional and knowledgeable.  I highly recommend Benchmark.
Excellent peoples very friendly helpful service
Enjoyed  the therapy.My PT was very patient and concerned with my well being..I am on oxygen and require a lot of patience.It was great and I am much better physically.
"Jeff McIntyre at the Viila Rica  location is awesome...I attended physical therapy there for about 6 weeks and the results were amazing.  I would definitely recommend him. The office staff were also very welcoming.
Noel Murphy"
I have been using Benchmark for about a month and the staff is wonderful. The staff is very professional and continues to amaze me how with the level of care they are providing.
Yele did such a great job on my back and shoulders! Dry needling did wonders for those muscles. I highly recommend this group!
Andrew really works with you and keeps chatting to keep your mind off all the stress your going thru .  After 2 other therapy places this 1 got me on my feet again

"I worked with Kevin he was amazing!  He is smart, kind and extremely knowledgeable. He was a pleasure to work with.   The staff was helpful and friendly."
"Mary at the front desk has always been a pleasant to work with and Tim has been very knowledgeable and attentive to my needs, tailored the exercise plan to my special request and been very flexible with my tight schedule, overall a great experience!"
I experienced excellent care with my visits at BenchMark Physical Therapy! My Coach made a plan for me to follow and we were successful in meeting all the challenges. Kevin and his team were  awesome. Friendly from the moment you walk in the door. but serious about accomplishing your goals
"I worked with Dr. Jung. His interpersonal skills and interest in understanding my situation was refreshing. He detailed out each session in accordance with my needs. And my recovery was a full recovery.

The facility met or exceeded my needs. Thank you!"
"Hello, all! My name is Dr Ben McDowell, I am a chiropractor. I have been referring patients to Dr Chris Ross - the clinic director at this Benchmark location - for four years now. He is simply the most awesome PT I have ever worked alongside. Whether it is to collaborate and co-manage a patient who needs both chiropractic and PT together, or a patient that has an issue that PT is better suited to address and cure, or anything in between, I trust Dr Ross implicitly and his results speak for themselves. In addition, his bedside manner with his patients is spectacular. It is rare to find a fantastic doctor who is also skilled in interpersonal communication  and pleasant with patients. You will be pleased that you chose this location and this doctor."
Chris and his staff are very attentive and patient. They did a great job on helping me improve the mobility in my ankles. So glad to be pain free and walking better. Thank you.
"Great staff, easy to
Work with. A great experience!"
I saw two therapists ‚Äî one for my neck and one for my arm. They were both wonderful and so was the staff. I highly recommend!
"BenchMark has gotten my daily activities back to normal.  Dr Ava Motakef was my PT, working patiently   with me, educating along the way why we were doing each routine.  Great staff, always happy and smiling with the patient's care foremost."
"I went to Benchmark PT to correct issues with my right knee.  My therapist, Ava, DPT, started me on exercises to strengthen and add flexibility the muscles from my core to my toes.  This entire group of muscles supports the structure, support and functionality of the knee.  She did an excellent job of explaining what she needed me to do and answered all questions that I asked.  After 4 months of PT I had achieved all goals and now have knees that function as they should without any pain.  Great job, Ava, and all others that were involved with this plan.  Thank you for everything that you did to get me back to where I am today.  I could not be more pleased with what you have done for me."
Dr. Chris Ross helped me so much w a great treatment plan for my hip pain. I feel so much better than when I first came in.  Friendly staff and really grateful for the care I‚Äôve received here.
Great attention to detail to help me recover from tennis elbow!!  Gave exercises to strengthen my arm for both daily activities as well as tennis!  Chris was amazing!  Love the atmosphere and staff!  Highly recommend!
"I've been to BenchMark a few times now.  Most recently, I was there for a shoulder issue.  I worked with Chris for about two months, and he did everything he could to help get me back to where I was pre-injury.  PT didn't get me back to 100%, but I left with the knowledge to continue independently.   My Dr. & I decided to try a PRP injection before committing to surgery.  I'm glad I did, as my range of motion is finally coming back.  I still have some work to get back to 100%, but I will continue on Chris's at-home plan and get there soon.

All the staff at BenchMark are fantastic, and I will be back after the next injury. It's just a matter of time.  :)"
Ava helped get my son back to running  again. He was able to get appointments after school that were perfect for his schedule.  And Mary was extremely helpful in working with our insurance company. Thank you!
"Eric Johnson has given me the best care, the most thoughtful approach and the speediest recovery.  I am so appreciative for his expertise.  Mary Waldrop is so patient, kind and professional in her many encounters with clients each day.  So lucky to have chosen this location.  Thank you all for how great I feel again!"
Second time with this Benchmark location. The staff and facility are great. My therapist was very helpful and caring. I strongly recommend this Benchmark team.
"I have been going to this location since late September to get treatment for lower back pain/herniated disc, knee pain, and treatment for flat feet and pronation. While I am not 100% pain free the treatment I have received has given me much more of my quality of life back. The staff is very friendly and professional and they all work well together and communicate effectively with patients."
Excellent facility. Tim is very knowledgeable and communicates clearly and effectively. In patient therapy is intense and helpful with clear instructions for home exercise.
I have gone to this group for issues with my neck and shoulder and they were able to help me with my pain and mobility in just a few weeks. They are extremely knowledgeable as well as friendly. I highly recommend this office if you are in need of any type of PT. I will always use them!!!
This team helps me every week; else I truly don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd be walking.  Claire is such a great listener and adjusts the session based on what you feel you can handle.  Tim is amazing too and will push you to try ‚Äòjust a little bit more‚Äô and Danielle was hugely helpful with a misbehaving knee.  And I can‚Äôt forget to mention Mary; who is the paperwork wizard and keeps the place running.  They also have a great group of techs that rotate in and out to help.
"I am amazed on the care I am receiving and the progress I am making!! Tim L. Is in tune with each of his clients, their progress, their limitations and what they are capable of doing. Pushing just enough and all with healing your body in mind. I am forever grateful of the treatment I am receiving. Thank you Benchmark"
"I‚Äôm not sure how I could be any more satisfied than I am with Claire and everyone else at this Benchmark location. My wife and I were a total mess after a serious auto accident and the attention and care we‚Äôve received has simply been outstanding. I‚Äôve worked exclusively with Claire and her team and they seem to always find a perfect balance between patience and pushing for progress. Even when I‚Äôm sore and can‚Äôt work something, they always use every minute of my appointment to have me working something else. Finally, the professionalism and knowledge are outstanding. Claire always explains what and why."
"Excellent PT directives to mend and heal my issues, Alva is a top staff member there!"
"Soooooo, Let me start by saying Chris's Ross and Mary Waldrop are ROCK STARS!!!!

Can't recommend them enough!!
‚≠êüåü‚≠êüåü‚≠êüåü‚≠êüåü‚≠êüåü‚≠êüåü"
"I recently finished a round of therapy on my knee and back. I thought the Benchmark team was outstanding. I worked with Tim Lonergan.  I found that Tim was knowledgeable and made the sessions fun with his great personality.  The entire team went out of their way to help meet my needs. I also enjoyed the flexible hours that let me get my therapy in at 7:00am before my work day started. It is always hard to find time as a busy professional. I would highly recommend Benchmark, Tim, and team to anyone looking for a first class experience."
Tim and his team - other therapist and front desk alike - are outstanding. I went to PT to work on a months old injury to both shoulders. They got me back in action and helped me understand weaknesses I had that I needed to strengthen to avoid other injuries. Awesome folks who seem to love what they do for their patients!
Unbelievable experience. The staff evaluated and explained everything with my back and neck issue and was beyond thorough with recommendations and treatment. Cannot recommend Benchmark in Roswell enough. Well done guys - you‚Äôre excellent at what you do.
Impressive. This team is on it! My back was in much pain and I was given exercises that have been very helpful. I really appreciate how much personal one-on-one attention I was given.
"I went to Benchmark because I was having severe back pain.  I was in pain for weeks and no matter what I did it was not getting better.  I was treated by Tim.  This guy is amazing!!! After two visits and about 2 weeks I was no longer in pain.  Although Tim has many patients he always made me feel like I was his top priority.  Tim was incredibly methodical and thorough in his approach to my care.  It was clear that Tim truly cares about his patient's well being paired with the expertise to deliver results.  I could not be more pleased with my experience with Benchmark and Tim.  Although I hope I don't have a need for physical therapy in the future I know where to go if I do.

THANK YOU TIM!!!"
"My experience at Benchmark was fantastic. I can‚Äôt say enough. My right leg was a mess after running an ultra marathon. Dr. Tim helped me understand the source of my injury, and how I can strengthen areas of weakness to avoid future injuries. Seriously...can‚Äôt say enough positive things!"
Very good place.
Dr Lonergan is terrific and the staff is great here. I‚Äôd recommend using them if you are in need of PT. I‚Äôm close to being pain free after a long bout of knee problems.
Caroline and Carrie are very knowledgable and compassionate  therapists . They have truly made a difference in the in the issue I was experiencing . I highly recommend  this Benchmark and all the staff employed there.
Staff is very helpful and makes you feel very comfortable.
Great people
"I have been at the Benchmark location on Crossville Rd in Roswell for four weeks.  It has been an awesome experience.  I have been working with Kevin and he is great.  He has had a lot of patience with me.  I will miss him, Caroline and Jordan as well.  Thank you for such great PT sessions.  Pam Marano"


"I'm 32 and have been going to physical therapy on and off since I was about 20. I have never experienced a kinder staff. Jessica, Michael and Jason are so warm and welcoming. Jason is by far the best Physical Therapist I have ever seen. He genuinely paid attention to all of my concerns. He also took the time to really understand my pain and it's source. I left PT yesterday in (happy) tears because my rib pain had significantly decreased. After YEARS of pain and difficulty breathing, it was such a relief to take a deep breath without pain. Jason is truly a God send. Benchmark is blessed to have him and I hope he continues to be available at the Pooler location."
"The entire team is amazing! From the start Jessica was so helpful with setting everything up with insurance and all that, and scheduling. Kate is amazing, caring and great at her job! She got my back feeling better after a car wreck. Thanks!"
I have been going to  Benchmark for about 5 weeks for my knee and leg that were on their 5th surgeries each. Michael does a great job of working me hard and teaches me new exercises every time I go to an appointment. Jessica is very friendly at the front desk and Kate has only helped me 1 time but she was quite lovely. I thoroughly enjoy the staff considering having to go for physical therapy!! üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ
They have amazing customer service Jessica at the front desk is such a big help and has a great personality and my therapist Michael does an amazing üëè job üòÄthank you benchmark for all your help
Excellent service by this group of knowledgeable therapists. The Pooler location was always spotless and the entire staff was caring and friendly. Thank you...my knee is much stronger and pain free
"I would like to thank Kate, Mike, and Jessica for all of your hard work and dedication and thank you all"
Great work environment. The therapists care about you and want you to improve.
This place is amazing!!! If your hurt and need therapy this is the place to go hands down. There knowledge and experience can not be surpassed. They also listen to what you have to say about what's going on with your body. They also carry most of the supply's you need to continue your therapy at home and will instruct you on how to use it. The therapist's here will listen and not just judge you and try to push you out the door. There bed side Manor is amazing they really are here to help you and they won't treat you like just another payment. I wanna give a big shout out to Katie Osborne my therapist. Even though we didn't big home that big win with my shoulder I couldn't have gotten as far as I did with out you!!!!!
"ct's like family as soon as you come in. Katie and the other guy for PT go beyond measures in a positive manner. The receptionist makes sure  scheduled calls to remind and also the whole staff is amazing, friendly, kind,,  sympathetic and generally cares for everyone that walk in. They have relaxing music, and not least works on you helping you in achieve your goals beyond
In the names Heavenly Father"
Kyle has been an excellent PT! He‚Äôs encouraging while also pushing you to  press in to accomplish your goals. He is personable yet professional. I would recommend him without hesitation.
"I am so impressed with the entire office, but especially my therapist, Stephanie Dean. She not only does physical therapy on me, but also explains in detail why and how my body has been effected by my cancer. Also, she gives me the motivation to keep on living the best life I can and how to do that.
Thank you Stephanie!"
"It was a good experience being able to share my concerns and be heard. She listened careful while I was talking. Customer Service means everything to me, it must always be 95-100% at all times, if not I don‚Äôt stick around I keep moving until I find it!!

Thank you for great service üëçüèæ"
Everyone‚Äôs nice and try to make you feel good and they make an effort to treat you the best way possible. I‚Äôm glad that I decided to do my therapy with them. Best place to do it.
"Finding a P.T. that understands the chemicals that are used and how they react is rare, I feel fortunate to have found Stephanie."
"The staff is patient and knowledgeable. They are interested in getting you well, not just billing you are your insurance. The courteous and professional attention begins when you walk in the door. You are greeted and serviced by Jazzy. She sets the tone for the rest of the staff."
"Very professional, and they care alot about what they r doning."
"The facility is clean and comfortable. The therapists are efficient, knowledgeable, and kind. Good job!"
Very knowledgeable and kind and patient! All necessary traits when dealing with pain and healing. I appreciate the growth I‚Äôve experienced working with Israel Branford  already!
Awesome therapy facility with very knowledgeable therapists. Would recommend Emory-Conyers to anyone that needs physical therapy. They are very considerate of your own personal needs as we are all not the same structure. Josh has been working with my getting back to a normal walk again with much success in my goal. Thankyou Emory for having such a talented therapist on board your team!
Thanks Amanda you are great. I enjoy the workouts which not only improve my physical health but also my mental health. Look forward to continuing working with you.
Israel was awesome I hope I get to go back because I need more therapy. But he helped me improve at 98% right now. He knows what he's doing
"Thanks Ty for your patience with me and your knowledge is phenomenal. It helps me to recognize the function and the whys of my recovery.

Yvonne"
Gteat place to learn and continue your rehabilitation. Great staff & Physical Therapists.
"The care I have received from Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center was and is exceptional. My physical therapist, Josh is an awesome therapist! Josh is friendly, very knowledgeable and oh yea, quite funny.  I so appreciate the way Josh asks me about my issue with my knee and the pain associated with that injury. The BEST part is he REALLY LISTENS to my answers and uses my answers to plan out my therapy. I ask a lot of questions because I want to understand what‚Äôs going on with my knee and what I can do about it. Josh gladly answers all my questions. They truly are THE VERY BEST Rehab Center for Physical Therapy!!"
"When I started physical therapy at Emory Rehab, I was in so much pain, I could barely walk or sit for any length of time. Therapy with Stephanie has helped me so much, to help relieve my excruciating pain. I  am very active and now I can walk longer distance,  sit longer periods of time to allow me to sit and enjoy a movie without a lot of pain. Thank you Stephanie.
Gwen Robinson"
Well I did fall in this location on 6/22/2020..I asked where the bathroom was and someone pointed it out to me.i said that is a long walk considering my condition..no one in the facility asked me if I needed assistance...so soon as I got to the door of bathroom I fell..  they said I tripped over my feet...I also skinned my finger & knees pretty bad.after I fell is when they suggested a cane..wow..my finger knees and body was sore from tryin to resist falling..it's very odd to me how noone seen me falling and come to help me..the clinic was not that filled up yet...It just didnt seem like a lot of concern if I was alright..she more concerned about how I fell iguess in case of a law suit..other than than the therapy is good..
"Israel is my therapist and he is very attentive to my condition and always tries to design exercises to target just the right spots.   He does not seem hurried or uninterested, always very focused and ready to modify if necessary.  Thank you Israel."
Josh is so encouraging and knowledgeable. He listens to his patients. I appreciate how he explains things. I know I am in good hands with him. Saying prayers of thanksgiving that he was recommended by so many members of my church.
"I have received physical therapy in the past but Josh Brown is by far the best I've ever had. Josh is knowledgeable and takes the time to explain what he is doing and why. He is also attentive to all of his patients. I would not hesitate to recommend him to others. In fact, I chose Josh after seeing him interact with other patients and have referred him to others."
"If I could give 10 stars, it would be greatly deserved! Anil, Ty, Jenelle (Physical Therapist) and Jazzy (Front Office)...are the DREAM TEAM! You won't find better care anywhere! If your physician orders for you to have Physical Therapy this is the best place this side of the Mississippi! ""Effective"" Physical Therapy care is in high demand and to find a team that operates in ""Excellence"" like this team is in short supply...Thank you all, and keep up the good work!!"
"Mr. Joshua Brown has performed excellent instruction  and services to correct the damage to my sprained right knee.  He has great bedside manner.  He shows me that he is sincere about his patients and enjoys helping people.                           Regards, Kenneth Parland"
"I am now undergoing physical  therapy for my fourth joint replacement.  I have used Emory Rehab , various therapists, for all my surgeries where therapy was needed and have always had great results. Very professional, knowledgeable and a friendly atmosphere."
"Great office! Friendly front office staff and the therapists are patient, knowledgeable  and result driven. Israel and Josh are awesome!"
I'm really glad I chose this facility. The staff is very knowledgeable & friendly. They all work together to get you back to 100%. They allow you to work at your own pace & they don't force anything on you & I personally love that. The hours are very convenient & they also have Saturday appointments & the fact that there close to home is icing on the cake. I think their reputation speak for itself bc I have met quite a few ppl that have been there on several different occasions for various rehabilitation needs & I'm sure its bc of the staff
"This a very patient friendly outpatient center.  I have been to other Outpatient Therapy Centers, but by far, the center in Conyers with the  therapist Joshua Brown if the most rewarding.  He s thorough and caring about the needs of the patient.  He explains everything he is doing and why.  He definitely needs to be recognized for his care with the patient."
"I love, love, love this emory facility! The staff was absolutely amazing! Dr. Dean was such a pleasant person to be around. Her and her staff took their time to make sure I understood everything that was going on and they worked with me to make sure I was comfortable at all times. Definitely a 5/5, and would recommend to anyone! The conyers office Rocks!!! Thank you all for all of your help!"
"Education, skills, and experience are superb"
"The personnel at the center worked very hard with the scheduling
and recovery of my knee replacement.  They were very patient with me and varied the exercises to maximize the best recovery results.  I would highly recommend then for any PT rehab a person may need."
"I came to Emory Rehab Outpatient Center thinking that arthritis was causing the aching in my right leg that was so persistent and uncomfortable that it made it difficult to drive my car. Addressing my arthritis, Stephanie, Josh and the team at this center determined the best treatment for me and I couldn‚Äôt ask for better results. They are knowledgeable, flexible with scheduling and have wonderful equipment to address problems and improve wellness."
"Let‚Äôs talk about Joshua Brown, attentive, Patient, and very well spoken!!!!"
Israel took time to explain the way the bones and joints work before offering solutions.  It was good to know why I was hurting and even better to finally have a resolution.
"Excellent staff  front desk receptionist Jazzy
Does great job of scheduling
me
Josh is an outstanding physical therapist,skilled,compassionate and very knowledgeable about anatomy and how best to treat pain and spasm with regular pt and dry needling
Thank you for what you do for us patients!"
Love the location. Everyone is welcoming and knowledgeable. Great experience. Helped me so much to get back to functioning.
It was very easy to schedule appointments that fit with my lifestyle.Although I had different therapists there was a consistency in my therapy obviously due to meticulous record keeping. Everyone was always professional and encouraging from the receptionist on.
I really love going to Emory rehabilitation I thank my P T Joshua is most definitely the best he really works with you
Stephanie and Josh are genuinely concerned with their patients wellbeing! They are well equipped and informed- great bed side manner !!
"Awesome staff, very warm, friendly. They make you laugh and relax while doing PT."
"The physical therapist's are excellent. There is such joy in me when I go for my work out, the staff is very accommodating."
"The PT's  at Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center, 875 Flat Shoals Rd SE, Suite 160, Conyers, GA  is the best rehabilitaion outpatient's center's I have used.  I was in PT at another facility, but not an Emory Center the PT's were not as passionate as the PT's at Emory.  The PT's at Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center approaches the cause and provides an explaination every step of the way.  To sum it up, Emory's Rehabilitation's physical therapy apporach is less painful as other rehabilitations centers.

Thank you Emory..."
Lauren Heber deserves 5 stars.
Excellent staff from the office to the PTs. Sheila who works in the office was friendly and knowledgeable from the time I called to make first appointment. Stephanie my PT is Awesome. She explained more to me than my personal doctor or Orthopedic Surgon. I highly recommend this facility.
He was very thorough about my lower back pain and explain the process of getting it to heal
Very professional and timely in taking you back for your appointment time. They call the night before to confirm appointments.
Their therapists are very nice and patience.
"Excellent therapist, very caring!"
Professional and Punctual
Great



































"Excellent care by friendly and caring therapists.  They know how to help.
I highly recommend their services...Benchmark in Ellijay!!!"
"I‚Äôve had to use benchmark in two different situations, and both times I had excellent results. They are the most helpful and knowledgeable people especially when it comes to hand therapy."
You won't find a more friendly and caring staff that treats you like family. Your treatment is given expertly and compassionately with your well being their top priority. The best part is you will have fun in the process!
Caring staff that knows their stuff!


I cannot say enough good things about Hillary and the rest of her staff. Fun professional serious and caring
"Recently completed PT after having knee surgery and had a truly amazing experience with Benchmark Brookhaven. Great listeners, well paced and tailored therapy keeping my recovery goals in mind. Can‚Äôt say enough about the entire team and highly recommend for your physical therapy needs. Top notch!"
"I had knee replacement at the end of January and Hilary and her team took excellent care of me. Always caring, encouraging and doing everything to maintain me optimistic with my progress. I highly recommend them for any of your physical therapy needs!"
"Hillary helped me with my neck and jaw pain, I went from not being able to sleep from the pain to being able to eat a lot, and work out again! She made me work, but it paid off. I don‚Äôt even know how that was possible as it felt like I was going to a fun workout, but at the end I saw so much improvement. I definitely recommend her and the team. Thanks!"
"I love this place and the Therapists Hilary and Alexis (at the Brookhaven location) are THE ABSOLUTE BEST! I've been struggling with chronic neck and shoulder pain after being hit by a car years ago and for the first time in my life am experiencing relief from the pain. Through a combo of exercises, micro-needling and massage, my persistent headaches have subsided significantly and I can sleep comfortably at night. Not to mention that the overall vibe of the office is totally uplifting. If your in a bad mood going into physical therapy, I can say with a high degree of confidence that you will leave feeling happy and renewed. The team is wonderful and they will brighten your day."
"I had a great experience with PT at BenchMark (Town Brookhaven location). Jonathan Joseph was an excellent therapist and was able to quickly identify my problem and get me on the right track to recovery. I was skeptical entering my first visit that it would actually be worth the time/money, but I began seeing immediate relief after visit #1 and it continued from there."
"The staff here is extremely professional as well as friendly. Cindy at reception is very welcoming. Hillary tailored a program that got me back out on the golf course pain free and without cortisone. She also took the time to explain why we were doing certain exercises so I learned a lot that will carry in my day to day. When I worked with Alexis, it was the same experience. It's clear that the staff here genuinely cares about their patients. Should the need arise, I will be back!"
"I have been a patient at Benchmark PT for several years and I can't say enough good things about the PT's, the front desk staff,location, and facilities. The location is convenient with more than adequate parking. The front desk staff are friendly and helpful over the phone and in person. The facilities are impeccably modern and clean and the staff takes great care to sanitize and clean all surfaces.The highlight of my physical therapy treatment has always been the PT's at Benchmark Brookhaven. They are very caring and design treatment plans based on your progress and what your end goal is. The PT's here go above and beyond for their patients whether its tailoring an in person appointment exercise or providing exercises to do at home or recommended equipment for at home therapy. I only gave 5 stars but if I had to I would give 10 stars. I know I can rely on them to be caring /kind and get me back on my feet !!"
"Convenient, modern facility with a very competent, caring staff that is passionate about helping their patients. Coming in with pretty bad shoulder pain, I wasn't confident it could be fixed with PT. But after my 6 weeks with BenchMark, I was back to 90% and able to resume my normal fitness. Not only are they great at the center but the app they use for 'homework' is far superior than any PT I've done in the past with videos/countdown timer for all exercises.  I absolutely would recommend Hillary and her team at BenchMark Brookhaven!"
"I am doing very well with the physical therapy designed for my upper back and neck. Staff and therapist are competent and a lot of fun to talk to, through our masks. They are good about wiping down everything and not having too many people in the room."
Alexis at BenchMark Physical Therapy did an amazing job designing my therapy plan just for me.  She and her staff were always so attentive to my needs. She helped me recover quickly and stronger than ever. I definitely recommend using them on your road to recovery.
Benchmark Brookhaven was an excellent place to get therapy for a shoulder injury! Both Hillary Botts and Alexis Daniel were very Caring and creative ! They measured me to see my injuries and told me I was making progress when I did not think I was. I tried dry needling when my shoulder was in extreme pain and it really helped. I feel like I have made friends for life and I would recommend benchmark Brookhaven to everyone!  I look forward to my visits ever week!
Alexis Daniel was my physical therapist at benchmark and was wonderful. She listened to me and tailored my exercises to my needs.  Thank you so much Alexis.
The thought  of having physical therapy was a challenge for me as I have been very fortunate having good health. Initially my thought was that physical therapy would help me get by with my condition as it existed.  Hillary Botts and the entire team foster and atmosphere of cheerfulness with laser focus which helped me gain a healthy outlook and restorative outcome. I have completed physical therapy treatment with tools and resources which empwer me to thrive.  If I need physical therapy in the future I would go back to Benchmark and I recommend them highly.
"The folks at Benchmark at Town Brookhaven are the best!  This has been my third time I‚Äôve used their services since 2017.  While the other two programs were successful, this time the experience was exceptional.  Alexis not only helped me heal and get stronger, she has taught me how to continue to improve on my own at home.  They are so good for the last month or so, I‚Äôve been making a two hour round trip drive to work with them.  If you need physical therapy, you won‚Äôt do better than Benchmark in Town Brookhaven."
Benchmark Physical Therapy was extremely beneficial in my recovery. The staff is excellent and very professional. Gordon is a great therapist if you are looking for someone to get you back to where you were prior to your injury or better in my case. I could not be more pleased with my therapy program and more importantly the outcome!
Hillary was a great therapist.  I would recommend her to anyone in need of PT.
The staff was wonderful and caring and Alexis did everything she could to help me.
"Hillary and Lauren both rocked me through my physical therapy. They provided personalized attention, changed it up so I wouldn't get bored, and made it fun quite frankly.
They are very professional, showed me how to use the app.
I highly recommend you request and select Hillary as  your therapist.
You won't regret. She likes success & will succeed in making you better.
Thanks to both Hillary and Lauren for making me strong again!!"
"Ryan Reid and the entire team are very professional, friendly, and immediately put you at ease.  I'd never been to physical therapy before but the team showed me how to perform each exercise properly and really gave me great workouts that I will be using from now on to help alleviate some knee pain.  Location is great too with easy free parking!

In regard to the one low review, the amount I paid was exactly correct with my insurance.  I would say you should always contact insurance beforehand regardless, but you can trust that they will quote you accurately.

Overall, I highly recommend this PT team!"
The trainers at this facility are AMAZING!! They genuinely want you see you succeed and it makes the recovery process that much better! I cannot thank them enough!!!!!
"My Therapist was Ryan and he is Amazing. All the therapists have a warm nature which is so welcoming when you walk into the place. They are very attentive and they always push you to reach your goals in a positive way. Ryan and Hillary are experts in PT related to Sport injuries and its easy to talk to them. I would recommend Benchmark if you are looking for people who will be there for you until you are out of the PT. They have given me efficient exercise plans which are different each visit and made me realize that i can do few things which i could never imagine doing. I was so scared of running before my injury and i never thought i could run again but after PT with Ryan and his team(Alexis), now i am able to run and I have gained confidence. Thank you so much Alexis and Ryan"
"Ryan Reid and Ryan are just amazing.  They are attentive, intelligent and have great bedside manners.  When I started I couldn‚Äôt barely walk, the pain was horrific.  After being treated here I have improved my health and have my life back again.  I highly recommend coming to physical therapy here with the Ryan‚Äôs."
"I am so thankful for Grace and her fantastic team at BenchMark in Brookhaven.  Grace's solution-oriented mind and incredible drive make me confident that I am always getting the most advantageous, beneficial treatment available.  Grace is dedicated to furthering her own education as well as the education of others in the field.  She is seen as a leader by her colleagues and is trusted to teach and mentor PT students from a number of local universities.  Grace, Victoria, and Tim are compassionate, humble, and hilarious to be around, making our sessions something I always look forward to.  In the month that I've been going to BenchMark, I've noticed an enormous change in my strength and level of comfort.  I whole-heartedly recommend this team to anybody who is in need of physical therapy."
"The people at BenchMark are a good group.  They discuss what is going on with each patient before they get into treatment.  Their goal is to help you to heal and be back to normal as possible.  They assign exercise that should be done at home and give you paper copies or an email and explain how each should be performed.  They make sure that you are pushed but not to the point of over doing it.
They do measurements to show where you are at from the beginning of treatments and along the process take more to show your improvement or where you should be at the current time. The staff treats everyone with respect and I enjoy their hard work and effort to make your experience with them helpful in getting you back to a normal.  Thanks to all of the staff at BenchMark."
"Everyone of the staff is very knowledgable and helpful in my rehabilitation,following a total knee replacement..My therapist, Gordon Peace has been outstanding."
Convenient location ( no parking fee) and Grace & the staff are courtious & knowledgeable. I had a good outcome in very little time. Of course all injuries are different but I am not a newcomer to PT. I can recommend them without hesitation!
The physical therapists here are fabulous! They helped heal me in a quick amount of time. Definitely recommend!
"I am not a patient of BenchMark Physical Therapy. Rather I work across the street at Keller Williams Commercial. I just witnessed ya'll walking side-by-side with a man, presumably a patient who gave it every effort and utmost concentration to walk down the street here at Town Brookhaven. Two things I would like to say... 1) I'd like to encourage this man to keep fitting everyday to be his best self! He was inspiring to me, and I don't even know him. So, thank you. 2) To his physical therapists... thank you for everything ya'll do... the world wouldn't get around without you. Thankful for your servant hearts."
BenchMark at Brookhaven is the best. Had a rotator cuff tear and they fixed me up good. I can raise my arm all the way up now. Thanks so much.
"Victoria, Tim, and Grace are awesome! I love them! They made me feel great again! Thanks ya'll so much!! I will definitely tell people to come here!!"
"They set up a program specifically to my situation, and actively changed it up with my progress! There's a reason everyone recommends them!"

"My experience at Benchmark was amazing. Thanks to the skills, knowledge and support of my physical therapist, my chronic back pain is gone and now have full range of motion. I feel wonderful!  Special thanks to Lien and Antwan for the endless support during my recovery! And thanks to the rest of the gang, Payden, Alison and Tia! I appreciate everyone‚Äôs help through my journey!!"
"I went here for ACL PT.  The whole team is great and friendly.  Did all my work with Paden. He‚Äôs fantastic. Attentive, he listens and gives great feedback. Highly recommend them!"
By far the best Physical Therapy I‚Äôve been to and I‚Äôve been to quite a few. Payton (probably butchered the name) is great and all of the staff is extremely friendly. Most progress I‚Äôve made on my back in 10 years.
"I was very reluctant to give PT a try, but am glad I did. Had nothing but good experiences at BenchMark and my Achilles is feeling much better."
"I've worked with several of the physical therapists here to overcome a knee injury. They are wonderful; kind, thoughtful, helpful and invested in your recovery.  Staff are very good at answering questions, helping patients to better understand their injury and the exercises necessary to correct the injury.  Paden is my primary therapist and has been fantastic to work with; he truly cares about the people he treats and is always willing to go above and beyond to be helpful. The atmosphere is fun, pleasant, and enjoyable. I would highly recommend this business for those needing good physical therapy."
I had such a good experience at Benchmark! Allison was wonderful to work with and got my shoulder and elbow back in working order without pain! I highly recommend the whole team; they‚Äôre great!
"I am so thankful for all the folx at Benchmark. I‚Äôve worked with each of them, and they‚Äôre all great. My main PT was Alison and she‚Äôs fantastic. You can tell she‚Äôs really committed to my health and well being. I‚Äôm also amazed at how they can multitask and their depth of knowledge. Sometimes I can‚Äôt even tell where the pain is coming from, but Alison will look at a few things and then she can see where my pain is better than I can feel where it is! The work we‚Äôve done in combination with dry needling has given me my life back. I recommend these guys to everyone!"
"Love this place! Allison was a gem, so patient and genuinely caring! I was involved in a horrible head-on collision in October and she helped me to trust my body again. I looked forward to every session and although I‚Äôm graduating...I will miss this wonderful staff üò©I would highly recommend Benchmark at Glenwood!! Thanks again Allison ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
"This place is the best, the staff is extremely friendly. You are always treated as if you are family. The staff is very knowledgeable , I definitely recommend this location."
"I've enjoyed coming here over the last few months. Paden, Linh, and Lindsay have been great to work with."
"This crew is great! I started a PT regimen with Allison roughly 8 weeks ago for a suspected herniated disk in my lower back and I‚Äôm virtually pain free now. She took an incredibly proactive approach - teaching me all sorts of core, hip and glute exercises to help solve the root of the problem and protect me from injuries in the future. She‚Äôs great at asking questions that help you think about the way your body works and what behaviors are causing you pain, and it‚Äôs really helped me form some great habits! Special shout out Padon for the dry needling (life changing) and Lindsey for prompt and friendly front desk help. I would definitely revisit this Benchmark location in the future. I‚Äôll miss seeing these folks twice a week!"
Benchmark is the best place to go for PT.  They have a very knowledgeable and friendly staff. I have been to them for 3 issues and would definitely go back.
"I have been blessed to work with Paden Wallace and the team at BeanchMark PT. I am 6 weeks out of a total knee replacement and I am doing things in therapy I never thought I would be able to do again. They listen to your goals, have the knowledge and training to progress you and motivate you along the way. My experience has been incredible."
"The Glenwood location of BenchMark is fantastic. The entire team is great, and I really do credit my PT Allison with my recovery. Oh, and for all my fellow germaphobes, they keep it really organized and clean."
Receptionist Tia knows absolutely nothing
Fantastic PT place with an excellent staff.   Very friendly and comfortable atmosphere.  Highly recommend it.
"My partner went to this location 6 times to get PT for her hip 1/2018. Today we received a bill for $1,053. The bill says she only made one initial payment, which is incorrect. I can't believe we are receiving a bill from them 1 year and 4 months after the service. During my initial conversation with the owner, they agreed to $50 per session, which is what we paid for each session. If you were told it's only $50 they are not being truthful. They will bill your insurance and then come after you for the remainder even though they agreed to a $50 payment. I've asked for all of the paperwork that was signed during the initial visit. The paperwork did indicate it was $50 a visit, but in the fine print, it said we'd be responsible for the remainder that wasn't covered by the insurance company. We knew this provider wasn't in network which is why we negotiated a lower rate. This is a shady business! Beware!"
"This location has the most amazing PT‚Äôs and such a great energy. I feel  attended to and cared for by not only Lindsay my primary PT but also by Lynn and Krista. They are all kind, concerned and completely helpful with my recovery. If you have the opportunity to do PT at this location, I highly recommend them!!!"
"Thanks Lauren and Kayla for working with me these past couple weeks on getting my hip and knee stronger for running. My hips were out of alignment from years of being left leg dominant in a different sport, and Lauren and Kayla have been working with me to get them stronger so that I could pound the pavement again. I have been running this past week and my knee is feeling so much better. Thank you again! I look forward to more PT and improving!"




My care at PT Solutions has been wonderful. They ask questions and respond to your concerns while maintaining a quality regiment of treatment. Everyone is kind and I‚Äôm thankful for this physical therapy experience while on my journey to wholeness.
"I went to PT Solutions yesterday for the first time and Chris was my physical therapist. He is so kind and very enthusiastic about seeing you get better. It was very easy to talk to him about my issues and the exercises we walked through truly helped! He was caring, patient and was able to provide me with helpful information about my issue! I definitely recommend going to see Chris and the PT Solutions team for all of your physical therapy needs!"
"While I don't think anyone likes to go to a place like PT Solutions, sometimes an injury requires you to do so.
I was initially hesitant, especially since my doctor‚Äôs office has their own physical therapy department. But, I am so glad that I decided to listen to their recommendation and visit PT Solutions of Dunwoody.
I worked with Chris for almost 4 weeks. He is as knowledgeable as he is friendly.
Overall the whole staff, including front desk and trainees, are awesome to work with.
I am happy to say that after my PT was completed, I feel much better and confident in returning to normal tasks."
"Today was my sixth physical therapy session at the Dunwoody location for rotator cuff surgery.  From the day that I made my initial consultation appointment through today, every appointment has been a great experience. The entire staff including doctors, therapists and Leslie handling billing are all amazing.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong. The therapy  sessions are not a cake walk.  They can be uncomfortable and challenging but the next day, I always feel stronger and better and I know that I am in the right place for therapy.  A neighbor of mine recommended them and I am so glad that I have chosen them to help me.  Rotator cup surgery can be a long grueling process and I know I am in it for the long-haul. I feel like I‚Äôm in the best hands possible to get me back to 100%. To everyone at PT Solutions Dunwoody, thank you for all you were doing for me and for genuinely caring about my health.  Your PT fan for life.  If I could give you 10 stars instead of five, I would."
"PT Solutions Dunwoody treats you like family. I've had the opportunity over the last six weeks to work with both Chris and Colton. They are both Extremely knowledgeable and know just what I need for my neck degenerative Disc disease. They know how to challenge me just enough to bring me to the healed point I am now. Additionally,  the front desk staff always greet me by name with a big smile. It has been a great experience!"
"Christopher May is my PT. An extremely professional and competent therapist.  Genuinely cares about your well being. I am pleased with my progress.

I observed interactions with other patients and found the staff to be caring and sensitive especially when dealing with the elderly patients.

Dunwoody has a wonderful friendly staff. Conveniently located and plenty of parking. Highly recommended.

l
."
"Partially torn meniscus led me to PT Solutions.  Chris May and all the staff were knowledgeable, friendly and focused on my recovery.  They answered all of my questions, provided at-home therapies to do, explained why / how doing what we were doing was helping my knee.  Very much appreciate the PT, the positive experience and the positive results."
"I came here at the recommendation of my dentist after experiencing severe tinnitus and jaw pain from TMJ. From the moment I walked in the door the staff was welcoming, encouraging and extremely knowledgeable. Before coming to PT solutions I felt very discouraged about my injury. Now coming to PT is the highlight of my week. My body is healing wonderfully and I feel so well cared for. Any question I have is answered with knowledge and kindness. The staff is so cheerful and fun. I‚Äôm genuinely going to miss coming in when my therapy is over, and I will definitely be coming back should I ever require PT in the future after surgery or for any other injury. Highly recommend to anyone in need of physical therapy!"
"The physical therapists and staff are great: professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. The office is clean and the location is easily accessible. They have worked their butts off to accommodate my schedule and ameliorate my pain. I definitely recommend. Shout out to Chris, Colton, Mary, Leslie, and assistants."
"Very satisfied! Outstanding group!

Came under referral from doctor and was in severe pain in neck and back but the team has worked miracles and I feel the progress week after week. The crew is so team oriented and friendly that I look forward to visits as I know it is going toward healing and the support they provide is excellent."
I‚Äôm a new patient at PT Solutions as well as a new hire! I began my PT this week and first off Colton did an amazing job with my evaluation and giving me beneficial exercises! Mary Rose has also been a tremendous help with first week of PT by getting my fingers and arm stronger after my surgery. I‚Äôm beyond thankful for everyone on the staff!
"From the initial consultation through the entire process Christopher May and the staff were absolutely AMAZING. I have traveled the world and his knowledge of my condition, attention to detail, care/concern, and treatment can be ranked in the top 1% of the world's best. This is my second visit and it may have been better than the first.  They remind me of the services I received when traveling with top ranking officials... VIP... Unmatched! I would highly recommend PT Solutions (Christopher) for any of your physical therapy needs."
I went there because I was having severe back pain. Chris was amazing and helped me get back to all my activities within a week with the correct exercises. Highly recommend!
"Great place very helpful and personal, staff is great and Colten, Mary and Chris really made this establishment feel more like a home."
"Chris, Mary Rose, and the rest of the crew here are incredible! Very professional, attentive, and organized. Hours and appointments are flexible, and the plan they created for me was easy to follow and extremely effective. I was sad to go by the time they got back to feeling myself again!"
"Chris has been amazing. I started PT 6 weeks post surgery. I was very scared of the pain and was both physically and mentally very weak. Chris supported me in all areas. He was a cheerleader and friend. I will continue working with Chris as long as it's necessary. Let me also mention Sarah, who is a student. Her interpersonal skills are excellent. I am so lucky to be under the care of such caring and knowledgeable professionals."
"First, very convenient location as I could walk across the street from where I live.
The staff was excellent. Very professional and caring.  Not only were they able to treat and give me routines to take care of my issue, they gave me information on various routines I could continue with after my treatments were over.
I would defintely recommend them."
"I‚Äôve had a wonderful experience @ PT Solutions of Dunwoody. Chris May and his colleagues were very fun, engaging and encouraging throughout my healing process.  Highly recommend!"
"Great staff on all counts. Auxiliary personnel is always courteous, efficient and ready to help with every detail. Physical therapists are totally professional, highly trained and awesome at what they do. I have been treated most often by P. T. Christopher May. He has always been careful to address my needs. He is a wonderful encourager and he consistently gives me opportunities to participate in my care plan. The entire staff works together very well as a team."
"Everyone at PT Solutions of Dunwoody have been wonderful. They really care. They are both professional and friendly. My therapist Chris encourages me to work hard during my sessions because he wants me to heal. But, along with the work, he makes it fun. I strongly recommend PT Solutions of Dunwoody."
"This is not a review of the care that was provided but their business practices as we experienced them.  We had a 8:00 AM appointment and they called us the day before at 5:00PM to go over the pricing.  We made the mistake of not calling them back that day.  When we showed up for the appointment the cost was super high based on the insurance plan we selected (which is fine.)  I asked them to give us a ""cash price"" if we did not want to use insurance and they said due to some contact; they would have to get an exception from the business manager to give us pricing.  So we paid the super high cost and have taken our business elsewhere.  I would definitely make sure you call and talk with them about pricing before showing up."
"I am a Parkinson's patient and exercise has become difficult at times.  I tire very easily and have periods when I am ""on"" or ""off'"".  Chris is aware of the problems that may be unique to me and knows how to address them.  He always seems to know how far to push me.  The entire staff is a joy to work with.  They know my name and are always ready to assist at any time. I am so glad that I now have someone who can address my specific condition."
"These PT therapists are absolutely amazing. They balance comforting bedside manners with absolute competence in what they do. I personally have gained much from my experience here. If you need any injury related help, this should be your first choice!"
"I highly recommend Chris and the team. They were all knowledgeable, supportive and made PT as positive as it can be."
"Everyone that I've interacted with at PT Solutions of Dunwoody has been very friendly, caring, and knowledgeable. The best part is that I am getting fantastic results and making great progress!  Highly recommend!"
"Great environment and friendly staff, facilitated the interactions and the progress. Mary Rose, Chris, Connor, Seth etc all real cool and very helpful and motivating
Def helped me out a lot, exactly what I needed.
Thank you"
"This place is AWESOME...therapists are all very knowledgeable, patient caring and understanding.  You do what they say and you'll be fixed up before you know it.  Mary Rose is a GODSEND...thanks for all you have done:)"
Highly recommend this location for physical therapy. Very clean and COVID safe. The staff is what really makes the healing happen with their warm and friendly attitudes. Extremely knowledgeable as well as creative with your treatment. They will find exercises that  work best for your injury. Big shout out to Morgan who was able to get me moving again.
"Chris, Morgan, Seth, Sara, and Leslie are wonderful assets for PT Solutions.   They are courteous and friendly.   I am confident they are very knowledgeable  about what process I need to follow to help me with my lower back and hip pains.   I already can feel the  improvements and am more mobile!   Thanks"
The physical therapists here are amazing! They are very caring and know what they are doing. They always explain what you are doing and why which I appreciate.
Great staff to work with. They are very knowledgeable and friendly.
"This place was so safe, welcoming, and helpful!! I loved my therapist Mary Rose and all of the other therapists and assistants. I am feeling so much better and know I can reach out any time for more assistance."
I had some pain issues in my legs after cancer treatment that was causing me to lose sleep. I went to PT solutions of Dunwoody after see an orthopedic doctor. PT really helped me a lot and I am now able to sleep through the night without any leg pains. Working with Mary Rose and Morgan at the Dunwoody location was a delight. They were very nice but demanding. The exercises they  gave me to do were extremely helpful. They really know their business. I would highly recommend PT solutions of Dunwoody and if you go here insist on either Morgan or Mary Rose.
"PT is great for my pain and it‚Äôs so much fun. Chris, Morgan and Mary Rose are professional and really care about you as a person. They are constantly assessing your progress and helping you move forward in therapy."
"Over the last 20 years I have gone 6 different Physical Therapy practices. Two of them are associated with hospital groups. Another clinic is part of a statewide medical practice. All the therapists that I have worked with are/were very professional. Based on my experience with these 6 practices I would like to highly recommend Mary Ziemba, Clinic Director, PT, DPT,OCS as the best physical therapist that I have ever worked with ! Mary has excellent associates working with her. Two of them are Ms. Morgan Putnam, PT, DPT and Christopher (Chris) May PT, DPT. My wife starts working with Chris on Friday. His goal is to help achieve pain relief for her plantar fasciitis which has really bothered her for a long time. I couldn‚Äôt recommend the people at this location of PT Solutions more highly !!"
I had a great recovery. Christopher is awesome! Great energy!
They are the best. CHRIS IS CARING AND PATIENT AND VERY KNOWLEDGABLE.
Staff and therapists are cordial and experienced. Treat patients professionally with encouragement and care.
PT Solutions Dunwoody is wonderful!  I had an accident that resulted in a torn ACL and meniscus and hat to get knee surgery.  Mary Rose helped me with pre-hab prior to surgery and guided me through post surgery strengthening and mobility.  Chris and Morgan are excellent therapists as well. The whole staff team (Seth and Leslie included) are friendly and helpful.  I have spent a lot of time with this crew over the last few months and am grateful for all their help getting me back on my feet - literally!
I had a terrible sprained ankle and the experienced staff here was able to get me on my way in a couple of weeks and back to playing tennis.  Great experience
"All at PTSolutions Dunwoody are great and very professional!!  I mainly was treated by Chris, and he was so patient, answered all my questions and could cure my aching back and strengthen important muscles!"
"Caring staff
Clean facility"
"Mary Rose, Morgan and Chris do a great job and are awesome PTs"
üëç
"Excellent physical therapist, great with people, and an awesome person!! Maude"
"I have been dealing with knee pain for over 1.5 years.  I worked with Mary Rose Z and finally made some progress.  Now, after I finally got surgery, I am back with Mary Rose and making improvement every day.  She is the best and I am confident she will get me to 100% (I'll settle for 95) in no time."
"Been there for two different issues, a shoulder dislocation and a nerve compression issue, and Mary Rose Z. has been amazing both times! She's attentive, caring, knowledgeable, and basically all around awesome. I admit I was very skeptical of physical therapy going in, but now that I see (and feel) the results, I'm a fan. Everyone there is great, but Mary Rose is a gem!!!"
I love the experience of PT solutions of Dunwoody
Had recent shoulder surgery. Team at PT Solutions are great!! Very friendly and helpful. I like the fact that they take the time to explain everything as you go through your therapy. Highly recommend PT Solutions. Mary Rose is awesome and very knowledgable.
The staff is so awesome!
"This clinic and the people who run it are amazing.  They make no mistakes. And their therapy works like a charm. Mckenzie is VERY qualified to  treat what ever  dis  eases you have. She is very conscientious about her work. Mary keeps things running like a well oiled machine. Together they make an awesome team. from my own experience, I say they perform miracles. I highly recommend  PT Solutions for your physical rehab."
"Experienced, professional and super friendly PTs!  Facility is exceptionally clean and they follow Covid guidelines."
"I was very skeptical of PT in general after going to another healthcare system for a dance injury a few years ago, and after months of treatment I was released and told to give up dancing because they couldn't fix me. After two years of 24/7 leg pain, I finally gave in and decided to try someone new. At my first visit they were able to tell that my leg pain was caused by a back issue, even though I had never had back pain or back injury before. Long story short, after a few months of therapy I am mostly pain free and am starting to get back to my normal activities! I worked with all of the therapists there, and each one was very knowledgeable and easy to interact with. My favorite was Mary Rose since she is a good listener, great at explaining concepts, and comes up with some really unique exercises to target different muscles based on what is bothering you that day."
"Very friendly, knowledgeable & helpful staff."
"I have gone to this location of PT Solutions in Dunwoody for 2 different  problems (an achilles injury and neck pain) and have received the best PT I have ever had! Notably, Mary Rose Ziemba is excellent, but the entire staff is great at this location. I used this location at the recommendation of my sister and I would highly recommend them also."
"Have worked with both Mackenzie and Katlin on my Knees/Hips and both do a great job.  Have used other PTs in the past and they were not as effective or through as the staff at the Dunwoody location.

Initially came in for the Knees but they were able to identify a sore hip was causing the problems and I went from wearing knee braces and icing after every tennis match to playing pain free with no help."
"The therapist that works there is phenomenal. Gives me individualized treatment and is always motivating me to get better. After a week of treatment,  I am able to sit pain free, and run like o used to."
All the staff there are very friendly. They have a good teamwork and work consciously always
Great people at great location doing great work
"Great experience! Very professional, friendly top-notch staff... Two  thumbs up!"
Have been going to Georgetown location for the past 2 1/2 weeks and have been very pleased with the results and the staff during that time.
Great PT.  They quickly zeroed in on what I needed to do to fix my problem.  Friendly environment with  a solid team effort from everyone.
PT Solutions they are very friendly and professional. They treat all their customers with compassion and dignity. It is an awesome place to recover from your injury.
Physical therapy  is great here.  Everyone's  so nice
"What a relief! MacKenzie O. was knowledgeable, precise and determined to try multiple methods to ease my pain and increase motion after TMJ / TMD surgery. Recommended by my surgeon, they communicated regularly about progress and found solutions to get me back to 100%. Professional, clean and respectful, their office was easy to work with, well managed, and ALWAYS on time. I'd return in a heartbeat."
"After hip surgery, I went to Katlyn Liley for physical therapy.  Katlyn was fantastic.  She asked me my goals from the beginning.  When I said that I wanted to play tennis again, she developed an individual program for me. The program not only relieved the pain and soreness, but continued to improve my flexibility and agility.  I am now back on the tennis courts.  I give credit to Katlyn for her outstanding PT skill and knowledge.  I highly recommend Katlyn!!"
They are very friendly and nice.
"professional,enjoyable, flexible. Hope the new office is nearby."
Fantastic therapy and therapists. Recommend highly!!!
Mackenzie is great!
The therapists were professional and very helpful.  They listened to my needs. Scheduling was never a problem.  I found this location to be a plus.

















Can‚Äôt say enough good things about the staff at this Benchmark location!  So far they have fixed my neck and back and we are almost there with my shoulder.  All of the therapists are caring and knowledgeable as are the PT assistants.  You are always greeted with a smile and the offer of some nice heating pads for whatever part is needing it.  Highly recommend!
"I have two daughters who have both had sports related injuries. Stephen and the other therapists at Benchmark are wonderful!  Very attentive, kind and professional.  They have helped my girls safely recover to get back to doing what they love.  Thank you Benchmark!"
I highly recommend this Benchmark location to anyone needing physical therapy. They helped me tremendously get through a very challenging case of plantar fasciitis. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable and they create a very warm environment to heal.
Callie has done an amazing job providing pain relief for my back and neck. Best PT ever!
"Great experience, friendly staff, and knowledgeable. They guided me through my recovery and explained everything during the process. highly recommend."
"I have nothing but praise for this group of professionals!! They really became friends :-)

I especially appreciated Matt‚Äôs experience and education, in thinking outside the box with different therapies for my healing process!

Feel free to contact me for any further input!!"
"The North Forsyth Benchmark is wonderful. My therapist, Matt Chandler, had been recommended to me and they were right. He was great, along with his assistants."
"I have gained use of arm, and walking gait and balance. Knowledgeable trainers, helpful and caring staff.!!!!"
The N Forsyth Benchmark location offers superb service and treatment.  You are always greeted by a cheerful and caring staff.  They work together to give you the best treatment possible.  Their expertise is apparent as you get positive results from each therapy session.  I would highly recommend this Benchmark location.
"I should have done this a long time ago .Ryan and staff were professional, caring and encouraging. ü•∞"
"I love Benchmark North Forsyth. They actually make physical therapy enjoyable.  And, The staff is amazing... they are experts in their field and so caring towards all their patients. I highly recommend this location."
"Everyone at this location is extremely knowledgeable, compassionate, very friendly, well organized and efficient. I highly recommend this location."
"I was so happy to finally find a place that offers pelvic floor physical therapy & actually takes insurance. I can't say that they will take yours, but the only other one in my network was in Lawrenceville. This place is a bit of a drive for me, but the staff there is wonderful. Nancy at the front desk is friendly & very helpful. Katie, the one that does the actual physical therapy is incredible at her job. She has already made such a difference in pain level after only two sessions. She has also educated me a lot and made me feel very comfortable in an uncomfortable situation. Lastly, this location is newer, very clean, & has the latest technology. I have been to many different physical therapy centers over the years for various reasons but this is my favorite one (aside from the drive)."
Clean and professional atmosphere. You can see the physical therapists really care about their patients and their well being. Highly recommended!
Had a great experience with the Benchmark Team at North Forsyth! All the therapists and staff show they genuinely care not only about getting you better but also educating you on your injury or condition. 10/10 would Recommend.
"I would like to thank  Benchmark North Forsyth for the best possible care over the past few months for neck and shoulder pain that has gotten progressively worse over the past 10 years. It started with a complete intake, assessment, and treatment plan from Van that included literature that a bulging cervical disc - C6 - like mine likely does not require surgery if you can strengthen the muscles that support the neck and improve your posture. Van set up a web based home exercise program that was later expanded by Tyler Reinoso. Nick gave me the motivation to go forward and encouraged me to exercise and swim at my local health club.

Nancy and Ashley treated me like part of the family as they managed my appointments and co pays. I am so impressed that this location is a rotation site for High School Seniors who are mentored carefully. Some of them will likely become Physical Therapists or Assistants.

These folks work as a team, call each patient by name, and encourage and expect results if you do your homework . In my case my pain levels have been reduced and my fear of pain and disability is almost gone. My quality of like has improved and I am sailing my boat again - alone - for the first time in years !!!

Keep up the great work !!"
"Wonderful, knowledge, patient and caring!  Started feeling much better after the first visit.  All the staff is very knowledge and patient as they guide me through the exercises.  So excited to finally get some relief for my back pain!"
ABSOLUTELY  AMAZING  TEAM WORK HERE .  They work so incredibly well as a team.  Everyone of them is there to help you and has a smile on their face.           Excellent care!!!!   THANK YOU          Kanira Lomiya
Highly recommend this facility if you need physical therapy.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.   Great group of people!
I cannot sing praises enough for Benchmark PT at North Forsyth! My husband was diagnosed with what we though was vertigo; we got in quickly to see Stephen. Stephen used the McKenzie method. After that was unsuccessful he spent time with us to get to the bottom of his dizziness. We cannot thank BenchMark at North Forstyh enough for their care and compassion!
Today was my first appt. The staff is very accommodating.  I'm very pleased with the help I received today.
"Wonderful, friendly, and knowledgeable staff. Great experience!"
"Very helpful, knowledgeable friendly staff.  Attentative to your needs for recovery."

"I started out with Brittany she was awesome, then I worked with Ben and Beth throughout my therapy and they are amazing. I have come a long way in 3 months since my surgery, now I have the exercises to do at home to continue therapy. I would definitely use them again if I need to in the future."
"I‚Äôve treated at this place for well over two years (bad injury). Megan who‚Äôs the Occupational Therapist (OT)(Also Clinic Director), is the best hand specialist in the South, highly recommend seeing her for your hand/arm/shoulder needs. I‚Äôve been seen by every Physical Therapist in this location and not a single one doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing (a lot of them also have several certifications). They all have their own technique, but in the end it gets the job done and your recovery on track. The physical therapy assistants are well educated and always make you feel at home.

The location has its entire storefront. It‚Äôs not like some of their other locations where u walk in and it‚Äôs like a small cube. Not this place, it‚Äôs got three bathrooms (no bathroom waits ever!) basically took three stores in the shopping center and opened the entire concept up. It‚Äôs nice and spacious. You‚Äôre not at all on top of other patients and have your own privacy basically while doing your exercises. Front office staff is always professional and prompt. If you need your recovery with a clean place, friendly staff and spacious store? This is your place!?"
"Miss Lakeisha is an awesome physical therapist! She helped me recover from surgeries on my leg and foot. She was extremely kind, patient, and encouraging throughout my entire journey. She helped me walk again and I am so grateful to Miss Lakeisha and the team at the Benchmark Griffin location. I would recommend Benchmark Griffin to anyone in need of physical therapy."
"I absolutely love benchmark Griffin more so because of Lakisha B. AKA Keisha she is hands down the best, PT assistant.!!!
...
My daughter has used benchmark Griffin and also bench mark Athens. My husband has used benchmark Griffin and now my father-in-law is using benchmark Griffin. He thoroughly enjoys going at 80 years old and seeing Keisha. The other guys however are great as well, they have thoroughly taken their time with him and given him the PT that is needed.üëè"
Great place to recover. Super polite and fast. Overall a great experience. Highly recommended.
"Both my husband and I have used this location. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. We've both been for our shoulders, along with my husbands knee. They were very helpful and really cared about our progress. We both recommend them highly!"
"Terrible customer service!  Called 3x, once I actually got a live person but she said she needed the order faxed.  I hung up, faxed the order & waited for her to call me back as she requested.  When she didn't call back several hours later, I called & left another message.  They've had almost a week to call me back, but haven't heard a peep.  I called Emory PT in Griffin & someone actually answered the phone & set up the appt. right then.  HUGE difference!"
"I have been trying to get my husband an appointment in the Forsyth Rehab for 2 weeks now.  He suffered a stroke on 5/24/2021 spent 3 days in Northside Hospital (which was terrific by the way), and was given instructions and a Dr.'s referral to be evaluated by a Speech Therapist as soon as possible at Forsyth Outpatient Rehab. After 2 weeks and 6 different conversations, with  them losing my paperwork and no call backs from even the manager, (who was suppose to get back with me today just to make an appointment) is really unacceptable.  My husband has great insurance and you'd think making an appointment would be something they do everyday... I've gotten to three other specialists in the 2 weeks since his stroke and we are still waiting on this place to make an appointment and evaluate our insurance... Just frustrating as all hell."
I am very glad I got to come to this wonderful hospital I loved all the staff and physical therapists It was a very good experience

"I have been under the care of Dr. Jordan A. Davis since I started physical therapy in June - and let me tell you that her treatment plan has yielded incredible results thus far. Her techniques are incredible.

She and her Staff are EXTREMELY professional.   Their office is EXTREMELY sanitized after every session.

She is very patient, knowledgeable, informative and caring; and has a great personality.  I HIGHLY recommend her and Benchmark to anyone and everyone."
"My husband, Ken, spent 6 weeks of PT at your facility with Jordan Davis.  He has ataxia and was working on balance, sitting, standing, and strengthening his arms and legs.  Jordan was patient but firm and always encouraging him.  She was extremely professional and knowledgeable and greeted us with a smile each visit.  She incorporated me in my husband's plan of care and always asked for my opinion on how he was progressing.  If Ken requires additional therapy, I will look for Jordan again.  Benchmark is very lucky to have her on their staff."
"I highly recommend this facility and my therapist.  From the initial meeting, Elizabeth was very patient with me when I had a little difficulty pinpointing what movements/areas were causing me discomfort.  Over the few weeks I was being treated, I observed her expertise in developing a plan tailored specifically for me.  She demonstrated and gave clear instructions for each exercise as well as let me know what should be felt. The facility is clean and everything was sanitized after use.

I now have the tools to continue my care and maintenance, thanks to Elizabeth!"
"I went to Benchmark for about 10 weeks of P.T. and the staff there couldn‚Äôt be nicer and more helpful. I worked with Taylor, who was so caring and professional. I looked forward to the sessions just because I knew that she was into my recovery as much as I was. She came up with a routine after asking a lot of questions, and added different exercises to make it interesting. I highly recommend this facility if you are ever in need of therapy. They literally had my back!!"
"The staff here deserves public recognition for the great service they provide from the moment you check in at the door and they greet you by name, from memory.
My therapist, Jordan, was extremely knowledgeable and seemed to enjoy her job. She would explain why we were doing a specific exercise and what I should feel.
The environment is laidback, relaxed while at the same time very professional, efficient and focused. The staff continually clean the equipment and beds and there is hand sanitizer all over. I appreciate this place being in my neighborhood."
I recently completed 8 weeks of PT at Benchmark-Lithonia.  Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful.  Jordan was my physical therapist.  She was professional and extremely knowledgeable.  My condition improved significantly in her care. I am glad I made the decision to go to Benchmark-Lithonia.
Kelsey and the entire team are amazing!! I have been to them for three different extremities of my body!! They know their craft and the science behind it. They don‚Äôt just have you doing various movements without explanation; they give you the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù to their techniques. I highly recommend them for any physical Therapy needs.
I highly recommend Benchmark physical therapy. The staffs are very patient with you and also show techniques that you can do at home. Thank you Mr. Josh for your patience and knowledge. You explain everything professionally and we are grateful for your help.
"Virtual therapy had been a unique experience for me,  but Ami Kirollos was a great therapist. She patiently explains and demonstrates, which can be tricky virtually.  Very professional, and still personable.
Thanks Ami!"
Kelsey and the staff are professional and friendly. They know each client by name within the first 2 visits. They really help increase your range of motion and quality of life.
"Talented, dedicated, caring and professional! Special Thanks! to ""The Punsher"" and ""The Bruiser"" for not giving up when I did. üòâ"
This place is very professional and prompt! I enjoyed my therapy sessions with Brenda and Kelsey.
"Kyanna is awesome!!! Great staff, professional,  courteous.  Really takes the time to create the most comprehensive plan & devices to gu I de you well on the toad to wellness."
"Thanks to Benchmark Physical Therapy. I had a nagging injury to my dominant hand and there was no strength at all. However, with the help of Ms. Dixon I am 100%. While there, I noticed the interaction between the other staff and their clients and they appeared to really care and were very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend Benchmark to anyone needing therapy."
"I have been to 2 other physical therapy companies and this was the best experience. My physical therapist was Kelsey who was amazing. I am very pleased, I got the results anticipated. Kelsey was professional, gave me great exercises as well as print outs of the exercises to use at home. I recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy In Lithonia, GA."
"As a result of my therapy, I can walk again!!!! I suggest that you arrive on time so that you can get therapy for the whole scheduled time.  Nice friendly staff!  If I have to go back to therapy, I will choose Benchmark Therapy."
"Worst Experience EVER
Do NOT seek treatment here! I was sent here for treatment for a work injury and left feeling worse then I came. Do your research before choosing a provider. The office staff was very unprofessional and unemphatic to my needs, they held on to my paper work prolonging me receiving treatment from another facility and made this a experience I never will forget! I plan to seek legal action against this company for causing me more pain and suffering. By intentionally holding documents that kept me from treatment elsewhere."
"I highly recommend going to benchmark if you need physical therapy. This clinic is so close to where I live; I never have to worry about driving far like I do for my other doctor visits. The Lithonia clinic is kept very clean and all the employees, from the office coordinators to the therapists, genuinely care for your needs."
"This is where I get physical therapy. The place is clean, has good parking, wonderful receptionist, excellent service."
"Great atmosphere,  nice therapist that truly care."
Very friendly staff!!

"I attended PT at Benchmark for a month and I couldn't be happier. Ramon was my Physical Therapist and from start to finish, he not only listened to my concerns, but he tailored the exercises so that each week I felt stronger. I loved that the exercises were also able to be viewed via the portal which allowed me the capability to try them on my own in my spare time.  Thank you Benchmark. Highly recommend."
"I give BenchMark Physical Therapy a 5 star review! A special shout out to Bill Bankhead - he is awesome! I came with severe neck and arm pain that interfered with routine activities including driving. Bill evaluated my situation and designed a treatment plan that included in-person PT as well as exercises for me to do at home. I am now able to drive pain-free, return to my regular activities, and enjoy visits from my grandchildren. The entire staff is friendly, thoughtful, and respectful to patients and fellow colleagues. I highly recommend BenchMark Physical Therapy."
"Lori Hanson has been exceptional, beyond what words can describe.  Imagine at 65 fracturing part of my ankle bones, a six inch steel plate with 22 screws and the limited use of my body for the first time in my life. Yesterday was the first time in 3 months that I hesitated with what ""balancing"" therapy was requested of me.  Actually, I stated that I could not do it and broke out in a sweat.  Lori and staff encouraged me on and when completing the most difficult, I was given a ""high five"".  Thanks to them I will accomplish a GREAT RECOVERY.."
"I was referred to BenchMark physical therapy by my Orthopedic Physician who diagnosed my right shoulder pain as ""arthritis"" , a consequence of aging.  I entered therapy pretty much convinced that it may do some good, but with little expectation of a miracle cure.  My initial evaluation was very thorough and somewhat eye opening in that my therapist believed my issue was more soft tissue than arthritis related.  I was released to the tender mercies of Lori and her team who explored the limits of my pain threshold and flexibility, running me through a series of exercises and bouts of 'dry needling' (yup... needles) that produced amazing results.  I even learned the names of some of the muscles involved, allowing me to impress my physician Daughter with my new found knowledge!  After a twice-weekly regiment of appropriate exercises and stretching, I was released after a month from their care (with a graduation T-shirt!).  I'm not yet 100% pain free (I'm not a young buck either) but I have 90% range of motion and am back to my daily activities and chores.  Well done Lori and BenchMark team!  Please accept my gratitude for your excellent care and professional skills!"
"Six weeks of PT for a chronic foot issue for the past six months. With very little vague diagnosis from a doctor, they worked with me on multiple issues that complicated my disability. After six weeks of various types of treatments and exercises they had me back to near 100 recovery and a normal gate without constant pain. Thanks to Bill and the rest of the team!"
This is the second time I have used the services of Benchmark in Canton. Both times I have left with great results. Staff is awesome. Thanks Bill for your help and knowledge in my recovery. Great place.
"Horrible first impression.  The girl who answered the phone seemed irritated and completely unwilling to help.  Interrupted me when I was speaking and said, I can't give you a cost until a day or so before your appointment.  Even though my insurance does not require a referral, THEY require a written referral from my doctor.  When your opening interaction is that unwelcoming and unhelpful, don't expect patients to be flocking to your practice.  I basically felt like they did not even want to see me.  Just awful.  I am in severe pain and that's the welcome I get.  So much for medical compassion.!"
"Do not go very unprofessional.  I never saw the same therapist, was always left alone to do exercises, and was billed for duplicate services on the same day which they still haven't rectified. I went to therapy hoping to avoid surgery but wound up in more pain after being told to do exercises reaching above my head and behind my back with torn rotator cuffs. I am a person who never complains or writes reviews but hopefully I can help someone else avoid what I went through. I have since had surgery and going to a different facility where they are wonderful and caring professionals."
We had a great experience with the whole team at the Sixes Road location of Benchmark.  They worked with us through multiple issues and were a pleasure to see each week.  Highly recommend this team for your PT needs!
"Great experience, met my goals quickly, very caring motivated therapists. Would definitely go back if needed."
I recently had total knee replacement and I'm currently using BenchMark for my out patient physical therapy. My PT Allison is very professional and caring about my treatment as well as my progress. She understands the challenges and pain that patients experience. Her approach is to apply the therapy and make sure you are advancing but stay at a level that is comfortable to the individual. I highly recommend Allison and BenchMark PT
"I found my time in physical therapy to be immensely helpful in regaining strength and mobility.  The staff members were always friendly, helpful, and professional in their work.  I had no idea how much better I could feel with proper stretches and exercises, and my therapist was very helpful in teaching me how to continue my exercises at home as a lifestyle change.  I would (and probably will have to) go back for further therapy in future."
"Had a great experience at BenchMark physical Therapy, My therapist was knowledgeable, friendly and genuinely cared about my progress. I made tremendous progress in a relatively short period of time. All staff was friendly and welcoming. PT area was organized and clean!"
Wonderful experience at Benchmark. Had a small tear in rotator cuff and fractured ankle from a fall after 8 weeks of therapy my shoulder is 100% and ankle is almost 100%. Staff were very friendly and were always cleaning equipment after each use. Highly recommend for any physical therapy need you might have
"My PT, Alison, has been awesome and the entire staff at Benchmark in Canton has been great; friendly, inviting, energetic and enthusiastic.  After shoulder surgery I have my range of motion and strength back and am ready to get on with my life with ""2 good arms"" again.  Thanks so much for pushing me but also being encouraging and supportive along the way."
"Every time I have a choice I use this facility for my physical therapy needs. Lauren, Lori and the rest of the crew there work you at the proper level with the knowledge and expertise to maximize my results. The fact that they are warm and friendly make each session like a working visit with friends."
"I can‚Äôt say enough about all of the staff that assisted in my recovery. From the exercises, the ability to work with my schedule, and the personality of the staff. I would highly recommend them!"
"Off the rip, this place is legit.

Ok, I am currently 37 and have dealt with chronic neck/back pain (thoracic) since i was 14. I've been to numerous doctors including neurologists. I have had X-rays  MRI's, and CT Scans,  Trigger point injections, and an epidural. Visited chiropractors, and other PT establishments.

After 21years of failed attempts to find any relief, the only relief that could ever be found was in a bottle of pills and other extracurriculars, but that life finally caught up with me. After losing everything except my car I checked myself into a facility to help me get things back on track.

I turned 35 in that place and it really opened my eyes to see how badly i had been treating myself. Part of my 2 year plan after the great change was to work on  fixing my pain issues. I knew in my mind what was wrong with me structurally, now i just needed someone who spoke my language when it comes to what's going on inside my back.....

Enter Alison Olsen @ Benchmark PT - Canton.  This lil spit fire of a therapist was not only speaking my language upon our initial visit but was also on point with what questions i didn't know needed to be asked. Like 'how much do you read'? I replied none. Then i thought about it, you're right, i dont read due to the pain. Stack of books collecting dust.....
Not only does Alison know her stuff and what exercises are best suited for my issues, she does this thing yall....Needling. It's alot like acupuncture but instead you pierce the belly of the muscle.
That's a sensation you just have to find out for yourself, regardless its the bees knees and you should try it!

The rest of the team is just as top notch, ask for Lori, Bill, Hannah, or Brooke.

Highly recommend  to anyone wanting to improve their mobility or overall health.

If you want a friendly atmosphere with a side of family these folks at BMPT will help you find the YOU, you've been missing"
"I just completed the very best PT experience and I have been through PT several times for back and neck surgeries.  Bill and the team at Benchmark expressed a genuine care for my recovery with each and every routine/exercise performed under close supervision to ensure I was performing them with accuracy.  I highly recommend Benchmark PT, especially the Canton location!"
Heroes truly work here. I started with this team during COVID and they have been relentless in helping me with back pain. I even tried acupuncture for the first time with them and they were great! Highly recommend this team that works together like family to help you feel better.
We highly recommend Benchmark at Riverstone! The staff is always very sweet and treats my daughter like a little sister...which she loves! They understand her sport and injury with the goal to get her back on the field as quick and safely as possible.
Everyone was extremely nice and professional and very helpful in my recovery.
"Great team. Very knowledgeable, helpful and personable. Thanks to their help recovered much quicker than anticipated. Thanks AO"
I would highly recommend them for physical therapy. Bill helped me tremendously over a short period of time.
"My experience with BenchMark in Canton was remarkable.  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful.  If I'm ever in a situation again to need them, I won't hesitate to call."
"By far the best place to do PT at. Everyone is very professional, friendly, and most importantly they treat everyone like family. Definitely recommend going here for your treatment!"
"I love the place, It help me with my knee cap when I got injury at work. They help people a lot. It a good place, when people get injury."
I had to go here twice for a bulging and ruptured disc in the last 4 years. The 2nd time i suggested to my dr to have me go here bc the first time was so helpful. The staff were all very friendly and knowledgeable. I was limping with sciatica for 5 months and no improvement until i did. They had me doing all sorts of things to improve my strength but alwaya checked my pain level to make sure i was comfortable.  Im so grateful for them!
I have been coming here for seven weeks and every one has been awesome. Lori and her team work really well together. I have told family and friends about the Canton location and what a great place this is. Thank you guys for being here.
I had a great experience at the location in Canton. my therapist was very knowledgeable and helpful
"I literally hate to leave a bad review because the therapists were wonderful. My daughter LOVED going to both PT and OT. She looked forward to it and they helped her immensely, BUT I have been battling for MONTHS with billing and Benchmark is responsible for their billing service. I am just glad that I refused to pay due to meeting max out of pocket when I did or we would be in much deeper than we are at the moment. First off, we were being overcharged each and every visit, which I DO NOT understand because the amount we should've been charged was right there PLAIN AS DAY on our EOB. It was $7 a visit, but when your child is going 2 -3 times a week and seeing 2 providers at a time. You do the math! Then we hit our max out of pocket, it was a bad year, right before Thanksgiving so insurance was paying at 100%. I didn't realize the exact date right away and paid for a few extra visits. I called Benchmark's billing dept. as soon as our insurance company let us know and was told that they would send it down for processing. This was in late November. I called again near Christmas. I was told at that point it would take 4-6 weeks. I have called 2x since and had to leave messages with no response. COME ON PEOPLE! It is not that much to you, but $115 to a family is HUGE!!! Not to mention it is just sleazy to not give us our money back. So, while we loved the therapists, their determination to hang on to other people's money deceitfully and with absolutely no communication has me telling people to stay away. There are other therapy places in the area that have amazing therapists AND ARE HONEST. Support those instead."
Great place! Been going through knee therapy to recover from acl surgery. Its been great i have seen a lot of progress and strength coming back in my thigh.
"The entire staff at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Canton has been so great! They are always supportive, friendly, helpful, professional, and efficient. My daughter received personalized treatment and we are so pleased with the results."
the staff was amazing. love getting close with everyone and them pushing me to my very best!!
"The entire staff was wonderful and very helpful. Kim Johnson was super sweet and really went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of! Thank you Kim!
Barbara Hilliard"
They are super great! Helping me so much with my many ailments. Love the care I get from them.
I had a wonderful experience at the location in Canton. The staff is very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Thank you all.
Wonderful staff!! Everyone truly cares about the patients and they all provide a fun and encouraging atmosphere.
Thank you so very much for everything you have done for me - now if we can get the VA to approve therapy a timely manner so I done have to always start over.
I have received the best care from the staff at Benchmark for my sports related injuries and I continue to go for maintenance check ups. They have a passion for helping others be at their best!
Very rude and unprofessional comments are made.
"It's one large room for receptionist, and folks getting physical therapy. Looks like a cattle call. Crowded and no privacy. Terrible!"
The Staff are so Friendly!
We strive to exceed expectations here at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Canton. Come see us for a free screening!

"I was unsure about going to therapy. But, I told my Dr I would give it a try. Soo, I did. And I am so thankful I did!! I still have bad days, but I'm on the right road!!"
"Sydney my Therapist was friendly, fun, and clear on instructions. She takes time to make sure the client understands the next exercise. I am feeling somewhat better early in my long process."
First time to do PT. It‚Äôs good. Therapist are very informative and know what there doing.
Kind and caring staff. My PT is very knowledgeable and efficient while showing genuine concern for my well being.
More pleasant than I was expecting.  My knee and middle back is much better.  My lower back is an old problem that I just have to live with.
Monica is a great PT and Melanie is the best PTA. All the staff are very friendly and helpful. I have improved so much with their help.
"Carolyn‚Äôs husband is the one being treated by ATI. I‚Äôm very satisfied with the entire Staff regarding their professional attitude, knowledge and attention to cleanliness."
Great atmosphere. Never feel pressured. Great group of therapists!
Very positive atmosphere . Exercise starts to help with issues immediately .
Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Clean facility.
Good environment and the staff is really friendly üëè
The entire staff is knowledgeable and willing to help.  Courtney always has a warm welcoming smile when she greets you as you walk in the door. Amie and rest of the team make me feel so comfortable and important at each visit. I couldn‚Äôt recommend this place enough üñ§
Everyone is so kind and knowledgeable. By my 2nd visit my pain had greatly diminished and i was feeling so much better. Thanks ATI therapists for helping me to be pain free.
"Great staff, doing a great job"
"They are awesome. I was a little nervous when I first went, but they eased my nervousness quickly. They are so friendly and caring. They are awesome with the therapy.  Love this place."
"I have been to this place for hip, shoulders, and knee therapy.  All the  PT people are very good and knowledgeable.  They have helped me back to full speed again."
"You are an amazing and professional team, take a good care of every patient and you put a lot of attention to every detail in our programs.
Thank you!
Janey"
Great and caring staff
Great service and therapy!!!
"So far, I have had a great experience working with staff at ATI PT. Chris and Ellen are very nice and know what they're doing. The that a great bedside manner, like to talk and get to know you. That's important to me as a patient, Ya gotta like who you're working with!"






















"Kris was awesome, patient, informative, and helpful.  They made appointments that worked around my crazy schedule.  Always welcoming and best of all you don‚Äôt need a referral.  I recommend them every time.  Talk about nice each person there makes sure they greet you.  Can‚Äôt beat the experience, I was going for my arm and mentioned my back was bothering me and he looked at it that day. If I had more than two thumbs they‚Äôd get how ever many I had.  Excellent place!!!"
"I was a patient at PT Solutions at the Paradise Shops of New Hope location, Dallas Georgia.  I had recently undergone my 2nd  back surgery for ruptured disc, and had very little strength in my core and legs.

The staff at this location was excellent. They were very knowledgeable, attentive and caring. That includes the assistants and receptionist as well as therapists. They were all flexible with my busy schedule. I never had a problem getting in when I wanted to.

Each therapist listened to my questions and concerns and gave excellent feedback. The routines they gave me were challenging and helped give me the strength I needed. When I first went there I could barely walk down my driveway and back, now I am walking 2+ miles every day and feeling strong and confident again.

PT Solutions New Hope/Dallas  is great!"
I love this place ! Wonderful people who were able to figure out what was causing my pain after 5 years and multiple doctors who were not able to determine ! They have lots of available appointments to work around and overall would recommend this place to anyone I know !
This place is great the therapists are concerned about their patients and their  well being and making sure you get  back to 100%. Flexible schedules.. would definitely recommend
"The staff at PT Solutions is wonderful. Everyone is very helpful and make it feel like you are part of a family, not just a patient. I have been a patient for a few months due to injury that required surgery, and I appreciate how the staff pushes me to get back to the mobility I had prior to my accident. I have been to other therapy offices and this is the best experience I have had!"
"The therapists at PT Solutions in Dallas, Ga have given me the tools, (exercises) that I needed to help relieve my severe plantar fasciitis. After only a few visits, I have 80-90% less pain than I have dealt with for the last three years! These folks have made a believer out of me!
Top Notch!"
"Top Tier physical therapy, the people here are amazing always super helpful the inside is amazing!

Kaili is amazing at the front desk always super nice and welcoming to everyone who comes in!
Super bright and caring like the sun.

Kris really makes sure everyone gets perfect care on their exercise, and is a great positive attitude to have around when going through therapy.

Assistants: once again always very helpful really promising underlings being trained. They really help out when Kris may be busy they know exactly what they should be doing with all the patients."
Amazing! Everyone is so nice! Been here for 11 weeks‚Ä¶ 10/10 would recommend!
"So happy I chose PT Solutions in Dallas to help with my recovery! Everyone that works there is so friendly and Kris, the therapist, is very knowledgeable and always happy to explain what he‚Äôs doing and answer my questions. Both of my legs were broken in a car accident and  he‚Äôs helping me walk again!"
"I have been to many PT places and this is the first place that I have been given detail information on:
1. What is the matter, why  certain area is hurting.
2. What I am trying to accomplish in doing a certain exercise.

Great place to come when you a hurt and need help."
The therapists are very friendly and knowledgeable and eager to explain every exercise and what the exercise is suppose to accomplish. I would recommend PT Solutions to anyone that that needed it.
I had over a 50%  Tricep  Tendon Tear. After surgery i could barely bend my arm . i was and am still amazed of how knowledgeable Kris treated my injury and others injuries. Kaili at the front desk is great along with the other staff. Highly recommend Kris for any PT rehab injury.!!!!
I have fun coming to PT and my knee is getting better! Kylie is super sweet and so fun to talk to. Kris is a very good physics therapist! Its a very fun environment!
"Kylie, the front desk lady is super nice and really fun to talk to. Kristofer, the physical therapist, is awesome! He has really helped me progress in a  short time. I would recommend this place to anyone that needs any kind of therapy"
I have been coming to Physical Therapy after my lumbar fusion and they have gave me individualized attention and care through the my time there. Kaili is so sweet and helpful at the front desk. Kris is now my go to PT! Come to Dallas!
"Everyone there is awesome! My 17 year old son December 6th, 2020 had a seizure, fell and broke his back. He badly fractured his T6 through T8 vertebrates. It was a horrifying experience finding him like that on the floor. Unable to talk,  breath
or move. It's been a stressful few months. This place is so awesome. It's so relieving to deal with such a amazing, compationtionate, informative place! I will recommend them everyone! Also, the location is the best! So grateful they're there!!!!"
I have been going to the Dallas East Paulding  Drive PT Solutions for about 2 months. I am getting physical therapy after surgery for a torn rotator cuff. I love the professional and personal atmosphere in the office. Kris is a great therapist and Kaili takes care of the scheduling and insurance. I felt ‚Äúat home‚Äù from the first time I walked in. I would recommend this location and these folks to anyone needing therapy.
The service here is great! The atmosphere is relaxing. Everyone does a great job with answering questions in regards to treatments. Chris is awesome!!!

"Very happy with the care I've received here so far. They are very kind, friendly and most important they listen to you. Very clean and safe environment as well."
"My physical therapist, Denise Hedgeman and my overall experience at Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center in McDonough, Ga was nothing less than stellar!"
"Doug Young and the rest of the staff are very knowledgeable, thorough, and friendly.  Doug did an excellent job helping in my recovery from surgery!"
"What can I say? When I first visited I met Mr. Doug, he had me hurting and crying at the same time lol. But he‚Äôs a great therapist hands down. The staff is simply amazing and the receptionist Mia, hope I spelled her name right is awesome, she has been patient dealing with me and my questions.
Ok, now back to Doug! The man is just great and I really have had an amazing experience leaning new ways to get my lower back stronger. Glad I‚Äôm a client of his. They take the time to meet your needs and customize a specific plan just for you. I would strongly recommend this place to meet your physical therapy needs"
Very professional friendly knowledgeable staff made it fun while they worked me to improve my condition thanks
"Great place. So far out from me, though."
Mr. Young very professional and knowledgeable about his job. He doesn't let up and make sure you do it right.
Very conveniently located. Everyone is very friendly and supportive. I used the facility five years ago and decided to come back for the current therapy. Doug is the best!
"Friendly, excellent service. Well equipped to accomplish personal goals."
Doug is patient and knowledgeable.  He gets to know each and every one of his clients and makes each visit a pleasure
"I not only like the convenient location but the staff is absolutely wonderful. I feel like family. They have pushed me to do my best during therapy so I can heal properly after 2 different surgeries. I liked it so much I have returned twice for 2 8 week sessions and i have now referred my son to this rehab facility. I will refer others as well. Keep up the great job everyone. You are truly amazing and always  do an excellent job.  Thank  you so much. .

Blessings,

Demetria Brown  ( A.K.A.  Mrs JOY)"
Mary Dickerson is the best Occupational Therapist.  She really cares about her patients and goes the extra mile to help their therapy progress and goes beyond expectations.  You don't get bored with the therapy and their is always variety.  They also offer extended hours and this really helps during someone that works 8 to 5.  Everyone at the facility is very friendly and Ms. Julie is the best at the front desk.  She is very professional and courteous.  I love going to Emory Rehabilitation.
I've been to 3 rehabs and Emory on Zach Hinton is the best They give excellent 1 on 1 attention.
Great team!!! I have been taking my mom for therapies and they have been very good we her.
Doug is the first and the BEST Physical Therapist I have ever had. I have experienced gradual improvement to my ankle under Doug‚Äôs program and God‚Äôs watchful oversight EVER SINGLE DAY! The entire staff are 1unit and are all amazing!
The entire staff is genuinely kind. They know your reason for being there is to work through an injury and thus they seem to do their best to make you as comfortable and at ease as you can be while they put you through your paces. I like that they explain why they have you do a certain exercise. They are a good group of people.
"Love Emory Rehab. They went right to work on my frozen shoulder, and I regained full motion in my arms and shoulder in a very short period of time. Everyone was courteous. and professional. Thanks so much Emory Rehab on Zack Hinton highway in McDonough. You are Great."
I have been to several rehab facilities over my many years and would not hesitate to recommend the Emory Rehab facility in McDonough!  They have the best selection of rehab equipment I have seen except at the hospital.  The staff is very professional and well trained.
"Convenient location that is easy to find. Outstanding professional staff that is supportive, friendly and easy to work with.
Clean environment.  Not overly crowded, yet everyone gets personalized attention."
"I just feel comfortable and safe at this facility.  The staff is warm and friendly.  This is the kind of service people deserve, and emory is doing a fantastic job.  Thanks for caring!!!"
"It has been rewarding to go into physical therapy where the atmosphere is so warm and welcoming. I so appreciate the personal care that has been provided for me both times with my knee surgeries.
Thank you so much to the wonderful staff, especially Cherita Nix, Physical Therapist!"
"Comfortable environment, knowledgeable people.  My ""go to"" place now for any PT needs!!!"
"Friendly staff and very qualified therapists who listen to your problems and design a program to restore your heath. All the while, they are checking on your pain level, your tolerance, etc. They are very professional and diligent about your well-being. I highly recommend the Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center in McDonough."
I had a partial knee replacement. My Orthpeadic doctor sent me to Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient for my rehab it was the best choice cause I was able to regain the flexibility of my knee in a shorter time frame then my Orthpeadic doctor had predicted even he was amazed.So I strongly would recommend Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient for any of your physical therapy needs and experience great therapy from very professional and knowledgeable therapists there. Thank you Douglas & Kim.
"I‚Äôve been to several PT facilities in my life but Emory Rehab in McDonough is the best!!! The therapists are very professional, knowledgeable, and kind!!! The office staff is superior! Best rehab around!!!"
"I personally, was skeptical about physical therapy in my situation ( a slew of doctors had told me I could very easily become quadriplegic, paralyzed ) . I was suffering from excruciating pain, limited range of motion, weakness, no endurance, and a whole host of other things. Being optimistic about my welfare, I gave my therapists ( Douglas ) all I had ( If things didn't workout, I also have someone to blame ) . I was surprised;  I quickly gain more strength, a better range of motion, more endurance, and most of all a great decrease in pain. Less pain = less meds. As a added bonus, I have more confidence in myself. I don't have to rely on others so much now ( my family members helped me out a lot, because I'm not able to do the things l used too ), being independent means a lot to me!  I'm enthralled with my progress. GOD bless!"
Kim I would like to thank you so much you have helped me in many ways I am using muscles that I haven‚Äôt used in a long time thank you so much
Very clean and staff was very friendly. I had problems with my hip and they figured it out right away. It‚Äôs only been a week but I‚Äôm in less pain. I highly recommend this place.
"They give the absolute best service and care that I have ever seen any medical facility take part in. Th staff is so welcoming and my rehab got me back in shape, actually I started back working out more because of them. #motivationteam....... Thanks to Doug and the staff. Love these guys."
"I‚Äôve really enjoyed my experience w/ Emory Rehab, Charita Nix is my therapist, she‚Äôs very very professional & she really cares for my well being because she wants what is best for me- she has an awesome rapport w/ all the other patients & she‚Äôs always smiling......thank you Charita for all you do for your patients- we love you!!!"
"The staff at this place know how to repair the human body and they do it in a friendly, caring and professional manner. Highly recommended!"
The entire staffnis fenomenal! Everyone is knowledgeable and intuitive.  They figured my back put right away. These are very genuine medical professionals.
Wonderful caring staff and GREAT location for me!

Great staff and physical therapists!!!!

"I had a great experience here. I never had trouble finding a time to get in. Justin was awesome to work with and he got me feeling great in no time.

I highly recommend."
"Jason and the folks at PT Solutions were wonderful to work with. You can truly tell how much they care about your recovery and always keep your personal goals and concerns at the forefront. They give you the authority to have I put in your therapy and make it a good experience overall. I can honestly say I was pleased with the speed of my recovery. And on a personal level, Justin is interesting and kind and keeps a mundane thing like physical therapy more of a pleasure. Highly recommend!"
"I tore my meniscus and when I saw my orthopedist, he suggested I work throughout before just giving up and giving into surgery. Justin and team were professional, energetic, kind and caring. They always pushed me to try and not give up. I graduated PT today üòä with a knee that healthy, able to bend and move without pain. I cannot recommend them highly enough. This is a great place."
"Great experience! Great team! Feel so much better. Justin was great to work with.
- James Mathis"
"Justin is simply the best. Expertise, compassion, results. Kept me out of surgery and had me back to playing with my kids pain free. if you need PT, this is the place you want to be."
"Justin and the team at PT Solutions are amazing! The plan and execute on a great treatment plan, but also provide a welcoming and fun environment as well. I would recommend PT Solutions to anyone needing physical therapy!"
"Justin‚Äôs deep knowledge and pragmatism can lead you to improved health. With his expertise and help, I was able to address long standing issues I otherwise struggled to fix on my own. Highly recommend seeing him for your PT needs."
"As a person with chronic health issues I know my stuff. I know when I am working with somebody who loves what they do and is really good at it. Justin is that person. He knows how to talk to people, he knows how to listen and he knows how to treat what is happening for you. I consider myself very lucky that I found him. I have been to other PT solutions locations and have not found anyone that I think is as skilled as he is. If you are a person who has a chronic illness know that you will be treated with respect here and you will be working with someone who genuinely listens to what your body needs."
"My 11 year old daughter broke her elbow and Justin was our therapist.  His professionalism, knowledge, and patience with her was wonderful !  She was convinced she would never straighten her again and within a short period of time my daughter was getting back to normal.  He made all the exercises fun for her, all while making sure to strengthen her arm.  The facility was also very clean and comfortable.  I highly recommend Justin !"
"Had the BEST experience doing physical therapy here with these amazing physical therapists. I have been in and out of pt for the past 3 years and these guys are definitely at the top of my list in terms of quality, efficiency, and friendliness. 10/10 recommend!"
"Amazing experience with Justin (and Emma) with PT for my chronic ankle issue‚Äîeven almost 2 years after surgery. Justin is patient, supportive and knowledgeable; he helped me retrain my muscles and my brain to understand my pain differently and regain strength. Highly recommended for anyone with chronic joint issues or sports injuries."
Justin was great with my son. Got him back to playing his sports earlier than we expected. Highly recommend this place!
I had a great experience at PT Solutions. Justin was able to manipulate my wrist and help me build up my shoulder and arm muscles to allow for increased mobility- so thankful! I highly recommend Justin and his team.
I would highly recommend PT Solutions. My daughter and I both had great experiences with Justin at the Crossville location. He really takes the time with each of his patients and truly puts their best interests at heart. I also felt safe and comfortable with their Covid precautions.
Justin is a rock start and helped me completely recover from a very serious shoulder surgery!
Received great professional care here that was tailored to my needs.  My recovery went better than I expected.
"My first experience with physical therapy and I was very surprised.  Justin and his team were always friendly, professional and on time and made this experience better than I imagined.  I would definitely recommend them."
I had a really great experience at this location. The Therapist Justin is simply awesome and takes personal interest in each patient he treats and April at the front desk is very helpful too.
"I‚Äôve worked with Justin DeSandre on two issues in the past 3 years, torn labrum and an arthritic knee. He has solved both problems perfectly and i highly recommend."





"My experience was outstanding! From the check-in desk to the physical therapist, I could not have been more pleased  with my experience and I would highly recommend PT solutions. I will miss Dane and Everybody else.everyone was so professional and caring. Thank you so muchüòò Gracias üòç"
Dane is the man. Talk about customer...he got it. He was so friendly and patient with my daughter. He was knowledgeable about all his training assessments with her.  The exercises were on point and my daughter's walking and balance have improved very well. Great job Dane!
"A great team of professional and friendly therapists! Exercises are focused and very effective in helping manage and reduce your pain. They are always checking in to see what kind of help you need and willing to work towards your goals!
Not to mention  they have a cool collection of classic rock playing in the background every now and then, that makes it fun to work out!"
"Excellent experience! The best place to go for PT. Dane, Allison and Rici thank you, thank you! üôÇ"
Great place to go have physical therapy The staff is wonderful. Very professional and personable.
"Enjoyed my visits in September with all the Gals and especially with Bond, wish i could of finished the program.*****"
"I love tennis!  But because of a back and foot issue I have not been able to play competitive tennis for over a year.  After orthopedic doctors (two) said 'live with it' my doctor recommended PT Solutions.  Within a few minutes of my first visit Allyson and Mattie knew what I needed and we got started.  I literally felt a difference in the first week.  The atmosphere is amazing - professional and inviting, fun and challenging.  The music is great.  But the most impressive thing is I feel better today than I have in 20 years.  Over a period of two months and maybe 20 visits I learned more about the muscles that control core strength, balance and general fitness than in my entire life before.  I wish I had met Allyson and Mattie sooner.  I would have started a prevention program 20 years ago.  Do yourself a favor.  If you love tennis, golf or just being able to keep up with Grand-babies, visit this facility and these two ladies for a long-term preventative care program. You will play and win well into your 70's.  I plan to do just that!!!"
The staff is very warm and welcoming. Allison is the best! She is so kind and attentive.
"Therapists are good but billing is not right, they do not provide accurate information on the billing. I had taken by insurance information and told me that my payment was only 20$ per visit and nothing else based on your plan. Now they send a bill and ask me to talk to my insurance company."
"The site is convenient for my family.  The staff is personal, knowledgeable, and very professional.   PT Solutions will definitely be a part of our family.  I would recommend their establishment to everyone.

Alejandro"
"Very pleased with my care and treatment. Professional and friendly staff. They listen to your needs and goals to help plan your care. Also, not too aggressive. Would recommend."
"Everyone at PT Solutions of Alpharetta is phenomenal! I went here in 2017 for about three months to work on shoulder pain, and they did a great job of helping me develop a personalized plan of care. I am now back to work out some back pain and they are just as great as ever. Everyone here treats you with respect, friendliness, and professionalism, and they explain all the treatments in a way that anyone can understand. I cannot recommend this place highly enough."
"Friendly, knowledgeable therapists. They play great oldies music too! Easy to fit appointments with my schedule."
"I've been bringing my daughter here for over a year following her two knee surgery recoveries. The staff here is great! Taryn, Trevor and Alison are amazing! I give a huge amount of credit to them for how well she is doing. I highly recommend the Alpharetta location!"
The crew here is really fun and helpful.  I came in with a neck problem and left was a smile and new friends.  Special thanks to Mattie for the tuff love.
It is an amazing experience being here at pt solutions. The staff is just exquisite and the appointment times are so flexible. They are very friendly and their one priority is to make sure you are satisfied. I 1 billion percent recommend this facility.
PT Solutions Alpharetta is the best place to go for physical therapy and dry needling. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. Stephen is especially friendly and funny:)
"I had an issue with my left shoulder that I‚Äôve been rehabing since Aug 17‚Äô. My shoulder didn‚Äôt seem to get any better until I started treatment at PT Solutions. Taryn, Allison, Trevor, and Sara are amazing. I would highly recommend PT Solutions if your looking for a fast and efficient treatment plan for your injury"
It is amazing!  Taryn and Allison are rock stars and Trevor is super nice.  We are already seeing results after just two weeks.
"Professional,  have the knowledge required to do the job and helped to recover my foot, ankle and leg from a fall. Everyone of them Tara, Allison,  Trevor and Reve know what needs to be done for a quick recovery!  Highly recommend them!!"
Very nice people. Allison was great with my wife‚Äôs therapy and helped me understand what exercises she needs to focus on.
Everyone is very friendly and welcoming the moment you walk through the door; therapists explain every step of a session thoroughly;  great listeners
Truly love this place!!!!!  Alison and the team are incredible!!!!  I walk in with various pains and leave feeling like a young lady again.  The pain during the sessions are worth it as she targets the areas.  I HIGHLY recommend PT Solutions and the team in Alpharetta!
Staff was really friendly and able to work through my knee issue and back pain. Highly recommended. These are people who truly care!
Clean and friendly staff. The facility is very modern and up to date. Would recommend to anyone needing PT.
The therapists are so professional and friendly. I highly recommend this facility!
"Been coming here for over a year for a neck disc injury. The whole staff I'd excellent, friendly and knowledgeable on PT. Would recommend coming here over any other options."
"The physical therapists at PT Solutions Alpharetta are working me good, helping me recover from two ruptured quadraceps tendons (SBQTR) and the surgery to repair them. I would recommend them without reservation.

I've had only one other experience with PT, about 7 years ago. That one was not so good. Therapist was spread thin, working with multiple other patients. Essentially, I was put at different stations and then ignored."
"Quick, friendly and effective. I give it high marks."
"Highly recommend, flexible hours and very friendly."
Very friendly and was able to help me through some tough lower back pain. Thank you :)
Everyone at the clinic is super friendly and provides excellent treatment
Love this place they are extremely friendly
What a wonderful and caring environment!
Good first visit
Great place to get PT!
Highly recommend this place
PT solutions is the best
Very professional and friendly.
T & T are awesome
Good therapy










I'm super late but 2019 I had to come here for PT and would be in so much pain due to a car accident but they would give me plus massages were I was in the most pain. It was necessary.
"The staff at this location is very sweet and attentive to the clients needs and injury. They go out of their way to implement a treatment plan for the client, that will help them get back to where they need to be in their healing. I recommend this location to anyone in search of a great physical therapy bc they truly get the job done, to the best of their ability and the client. Keep up the great work team and thank you all for what you have done for me so far."
"The staff was friendly and pleasant and my therapist, Jeffrey, was very knowledgeable and helpful."
"Andrew, Daphne and Will are awesome! I don‚Äôt have any therapy with Hannah but only hear good things about her as well. The atmosphere is comfortable with a cool vibe inside. Andrew plays dusties (Old School) from the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs which makes me want to work through the pain. I shimmy a little in my seat. For me, it‚Äôs a Chicago backyard party that works on my physical in Douglasville. They make you feel like you‚Äôre at home.

Andrew always has a fun fact to share with everyone. I always leave learning something from him every day. I may walk through the door on occasion a sourpuss in pain but; I leave with a well worked treatment plan that encourages my healing mentally and physically.

I have purchased equipment and a cold pack to treat my limb that had surgery on it. Both items were purchased at a minimal cost. My regimen is satisfying and I look forward to coming to physical therapy at Benchmark in Douglasville.

Thanks guys for making healing fun and informative!"
Everyone at Benchmark was extremely helpful in my recovery from double shoulder replacement surgeries. Every physical therapist listened carefully to my comments about pain or strength and was concerned about my rehabilitation. I can't say enough wonderful things about Benchmark and Douglasville and their highly trained therapists.
Excellent staff always welcoming and you can tell they care. I would 100% recommend BenchMark Physical Therapy to anyone needed rehabilitation after an injury or surgery!
Sam was an incredible therapist.  I was in therapy for a rotator cuff injury.  The staff here is awesome helping any way they can.  I will miss seeing the staff.
Benchmark PT Chapel Hill gave me the individualized care needed to get me healthy again. Each therapist truly cared about my progress and were very personable.
I was pleasantly surprised for a storefront location. It was professional from start to finish.
"Thanks to benchmark,
I'm able to return to work an use my left hand again"


"Professional and helpful phone etiquette.
Warm introduction in to their facility.

First impression: clean, organized and I witnessed cleaning after patients.

Therapist is upbeat, listens (genuinely cares), offers reasonable suggestions, pays attention to your bodies natural resistance. (She isn't aggressive  is my point.)
She is reasonable with goals.

I've gone a few times now, and this is just who they are.
No front.
Real.

It's easy to feel comfortable there.

Excellent experiences so far.

I actually look forward to going back.

Real asset to our town."

"I‚Äôve had multiple Physical Therapy sessions over the past 18 years due to osteoarthritis and surgeries.  Sarah King is working with me now and she is tremendous!  Smart, knowledgeable, friendly and caring are a few of her characteristics; she‚Äôs not pushy but you find yourself hitting your goals and getting better.  Kudos Sarah!  Thank you!"
"Best decision of my life.

I got into a very bad accident in march of 2021. I completely tore my MCL (along with other injuries), and was initially told by my surgeon that I definitely needed surgery.

After a lot of thought and anxiety, I decided to get a second surgeon's opinion. He directed me to Amber to see if I could avoid the surgery route. After several months, I have seen tremendous improvement and no longer require surgery. She was very diligent and knowledgeable, and worked with me each week to get me to the point I am today. Highly recommend Amber, she's amazing!"
"My experience at Benchmark Physical Therapy was great! I sprained my ankle about two months ago playing basketball, and I have been working with them to strengthen my ankle. As of today, I have finally graduated and released to go play again thanks to Steven. Their whole team is wonderful at their job, and all the workouts were catered to my specific injury. They were even able to make the sessions fun! Overall, my ankle‚Äôs mobility and strength has massively improved. I couldn‚Äôt be more thankful for such an amazing physical therapist!"
"Friendly, efficient and knowledgeable staff - Riyaz's deep massage  of my injured foot worked wonders!  I can walk so much better!!  Thank you!!!"
"Stephen is great. He helped me tremendously after my accident. My first session I could barely be touched without bursting into tears right raising my arms, now even though I still have pain, I can finally walk my 95 pound dog and turn my head without any extra pain. Thank you so much Stephen and everyone else who helped me during my sessions. I will be forever grateful!"
Dr Riyaz has been a wonderful physical therapist. He is extremely knowledgeable and creative in his plan for my therapy. Kudos to dr Riyaz
Highest quality care here! Steve is awesome & put me on a great exercise program to get me active again after my knee surgery. He constantly challenged me & taught me how to safely challenge myself. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place. Exceptionally clean & organized. Thanks to Amber & Anna as well. They are sure to meet your needs. Highly recommend them! Thank you!
"I've spent a lot of time with Benchmark over the past 6 months because of two separate injuries. Under the guidance and direction of Dr. Steven Hightshue, recovery from both injuries have been extremely successful. I can now walk normally with no hint of pain from my knee replacement and I can stand and sit for extended periods of time with no back pain. Excellent place for therapy and I highly recommend them."
Steve was awesome. He was able to create a well rounded treatment plan which helped to bring significant improvement in the treatment area. Steve modified his treatments to suit my needs and areas of concerns. He has also provided with at home exercises which I can continue upon completion of my treatment. The facility is clean and the staff ensures all equipment is cleaned after single use.
"I went to Benchmark, Suwanee, GA location, for therapy on my lower back (sacroiliac joint). Physio therapist, Steve, conducted a very detailed and thorough evaluation of my situation. And, he walked me through a treatment plan that suits me. Steve is very passionate in his work, he worked with me very patiently as I made progress on each front. He provided me with resources that I can use to practice at home and guided me on the whole process. Steve patiently answered all my questions. He is a very nice person, very knowledgeable and skilled professional. I am so lucky to find Steve and i recommend him greatly. Thanks!"
I began my PT journey with Benchmark back towards the end of August.  I had a complete tear of my left Achilles and to have it surgically repaired.  I thought I would be lucky to be running again by next spring.  From my first day Steven assured me that I would be on my feet moving again before December.  He was right on!  Thank you so much to Steven and Anna at Suwanee Benchmark Therapy!  Steven clearly set out my course of therapy and made sure I was hitting all the necessary milestones to get me moving.  Each and every time I came I was making positive progress.  I'd highly recommend him for any recovery journey you are engaged in.  Also shout out to Anna for keeping my scheduling on track and making sure I got the time slots that worked for my schedule.
Steve did a great job in explaining and educating me on how to treat my calf sprain.  He clearly demonstrated the exercises and made sure I knew how to do them so I could recreate them at the gym or home.  He was a pleasure to work with.  Highly recommend!
It was a very positive professional experience and at my request I could communicate in my native language. Special thanks to Dr. Steven Hightshue
"I had a wonderful experience with therapist Steve. The location and staff are great. The services provided by Steve are parallel to none. I play tennis, and hurt my right shoulder. My doctor suggested therapy, and I tried a therapist from Resurgens for a few weeks, while my wife was going to Benchmark, Suwanee, and she recommended Steve to me. After a few weeks at Resurgens, I made the decision to try out Benchmark. The detailed evaluation and identification of my pain points, the way he explained every detail was God sent for me. I was very worried that I may not be able to play again, a few weeks after the therapy he asked me to play and note down if I saw any issue. He worked with me on every problem I had, and even he suggested a few general tips of preventing re-injury. He spends the dedicated time on each patient, and passionately pursues the every reported issue. I could not have been happier anywhere else, and on my last day. I highly recommend Steve, and this benchmark location. Thank you Steve, and God bless you!"
"I cannot give enough stars to the BenchMark Physical Therapy location in Suwanee, GA.  The therapist at this BenchMark location are amazing.   During my many weeks of physical therapy, I worked with Sarah, Ellen and Mary.   All are wonderful!   They are encouraging, friendly, inspiring, supporting and gave me the right exercises at the right time in my progression.   They challenged me, while motivating me to continue improving.   I highly, highly recommend this BenchMark location!!!"
"Had severe balance, dizziness issues along with tinnitus. Twelve visits spread in six weeks largely restored my balance and my walking improved significantly. My dizziness is largely gone except for some minor trouble I suffer in the morning which goes away as the day progresses. Exercise regime at the facility was very appropriate for me for which I complement the staff and its leadership."
"Steven Hightshue has been providing PT for 6 visits for neck and back injuries. He has been compassionate, a good listener, knowledgeable and successful at making me feel better. He is optimistic and remembers the specifics of my case each time I show up."
I have to admit I was kind of a skeptic of physical therapy but after visiting Benchmark for the past 6 weeks has helped tremendously. Steven (and at the time I went there was a student named Kam that was helping him) did an awesome job explaining all of the exercises/routines they had me doing and how they would help. They were also able to answer any question and I had and reassure me through the whole process. I would recommend them to anyone who is dealing with pain that can be resolved through P.T. cause I feel great after just these short few weeks. Thanks Benchmark!
"My wife and I have been patients at Benchmark in Suwanee, Gal, her for sciatica and me for back and ankle problems.  We are very pleased with the care we received, especially from Elliot Teh and his assistants.  All were very caring and gentle, yet firm and demanding enough to push us towards a successful recovery.  If we have a need for PT in the future, we will definitely go to Benchmark and ask for Elliot."
"Highly recommend Johns Creek Benchmark. Professional, knowledgeable and friendly staff.  I've been using their services a couple of times and have got very good results.  My PT Elliot and also Camille are the best in the business and genuinely interested in your progress and well-being."
"The staff here is awesome!  I've been on several occasions for different injuries and I've been very pleased with recovery each time.  I'm always seen in a timely manner and they have flexible scheduling to accommodate my travel needs.  The PTs, Neema and Jen, spend time genuinely building relationships with each patient and are incredibly talented at their work.  They always have great support in the office as well.  Highly recommend!"
"Each visit is painfully pleasant and the staff is extremely friendly. A special thanks to Neema Mehta whom has insured my rapid progression. Furthermore, the entire team is knowledgeable and compassionate."
Need more employee. 2 employee per 4 patients
"(Translated by Google) Hello, three months ago I arrived at this clinic after an operation on my right arm and I can say that thanks to the care I have received, my recovery has been a success.

I bring my son here following a car accident. He receives treatment from Anna. She takes such good care of him. She‚Äôs very patient and fun. Perfect personality for a child. He adores her. The whole staff is very considerate and sweet as well. We love PT Solutions of Milton!!
"PT Solutions of Crabapple treated me following hip surgery.  Jenna is an outstanding therapist.  She explains treatment plans/objectives and the exercises/therapies in easy-to-understand language.  Jenna asks lots of questions and listens.  She was able to adapt treatment to whatever condition I was in at the start of each session, making necessary adjustments as we progressed.  Highly recommended."
I went to PT Solutions after knee surgery and really had a great experience.  Jenna and Olivia made it an enjoyable experience that really helped my recovery go quickly and with great results.
Both my son and I have been patients at PT Solutions of Crabapple here in Milton and the experience has always been fantastic. Both Taryn and Jenna are great therapists and the clinic has a great family atmosphere.



"I recently completed several sessions of PT at the Grayson, GA location and I had a great experience. Michelle is an awesome therapist and was wonderful to work with. Also, she was assisted by Sebastian, a student therapist, and he was also great to work with and has a bright future. I really appreciate all that they did for me!"
I had a great experience with Benchmark. The therapist are very knowledgeable & helpful! I'm beyond impressed with the teamwork and pleasant atmosphere at the Grayson location.
Went for treatment on my shoulder.  Meg knew what she was doing and was great.  Everyone was very professional and helpful.
These folks got me back to 100% after rotator cuff surgery. They are very knowledgeable. Everyone there is friendly and helpful. I highly recommend them.
"PT services are okay to me. However, billing is a nightmare. Two bills have resulted in more than an hour of phone calls. I have ZERO confidence in their billing department. The PT location will refer you to their offsite billing department, and the billing department will refer you to the PT location. ENDLESS loop of no help!  I will never return to BenchMark."
"Best PTs ever, and I've been to a few.  They really work in conjunction with your doctors for your best health outcome!"
The staff there are very concerning in wanting to help you get better. You can tell they absolutely love their job.
"Call today to make an appointment ! A lady by the name of Kim answered the phone. She left me on hold for 15 min.and never came back on the line so I hung up and called back at which time I told her you left me in hold for 15 min. She said Im sorry how can I help you.
If this how I'm treated before I get to the office I'll pass  !"
"The 1st thing I encountered at BenchMark was professionalism on the phone.2nd was the clean smell and appearance at my 1st visit coupled with the professionalism, knowledge, displayed concern and support exhibited by each team member. The team at BenchMark on Tobacco Road invested in my health and recovery not just for the moment but for life. With me and other clients they motivated with encouragement and understanding. Recommend this team!"
Friendly atmosphere and they took the time out  to access my issue and also gave me some exercises to do at home.
"If you have to be in physical therapy this is the place to be. There is absolutely no doubt that when Aubrey & Scott are in the clinic they give 110% of their energy & resources to their patients. I know that my well-being is their absolute top priority & they will do whatever it takes to help me succeed. While i hope i never have to be in PT again, i would choose them over & over again. I achieved 8 years worth of goals in 8 short months. From the front to the back of the clinic the staff take great care of you! Aubrey & Scott are simply the best."
The entirety of the staff were very personable and treated me like their own family every time I came in. Highly recommend!
This have been the best experience I have ever had. Aubrey and Scott were amazing. I always felt their support in my recovery. They knew just what to do. Going here you want be disappointed. They care about your recover just as if it was there own. Amazing environment to be in. Hate my time with them is complete.
Awesome staff. Very accommodating. They listen and actually adapt treatment to needs presented.
"If you have to be in Physical Therapy, this is where you want to be. Scott & Aubrey will go above & beyond to make you feel like royalty. Everyone is a VIP patient & treated like such. They made 8 years worth of dreams come true in 8 short months! They are life changers. You truly won‚Äôt find better!"
"A very calm and relaxing environment. Always made me feel welcome and very attentive. Would absolutely highly recommend their services. Thanks again Albry  & Scott , along with their assistants stepping in as well. You all are the best. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Scott and Aubrey are the best ! Wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else for my PT !
"My physical therapist Scott I was the best, he and his team made my visits very comfortable. Scott listened to what I said about my pain levels and. Fixed me with soothing results. Of course I would recommend anyone to benchmark. This won't be my last rodeo with you Scott. See you soon in the next one"
"Scott, audrey, and staff. They are the best at taking care of  your needs . I was a project for all of them , they take time to listen to your needs as well as making your visit comfortable during your rehabilitation workouts. The best part is the Dry Needling and cupping follow with hot wraps!  And most of all, they become family! Wish I were still there!  Thank you Benchmark, Scott, Audrey, Towanda, Staff."
Such a great place to get Physical Therapy.   I truly enjoyed the therapist they really helped to make you feel comfortable and that you walk away feeling great!  I would highly recommend this therapist office to everyone I know just so they can get the same experiences that I had.
"Very thorough evaluation and care plan. Aubrey and Scott took excellent care of my issues and introduced me to new techniques. Scheduling was also excellent and met my needs completely! If you are in need of Physical Therapy try Benchmark,
I think you will be well satisfied.
10+++"
"I was in a car accident, hit from behind. The hospital and the Spine specialist initially recommended surgery and/or epidural steroid injections in my neck. I didn't want neither. My first visit at Benchmark I told Scott the PT to help me to where I would not need surgery or injections, and he did! I've completed my treatment and doing much better. The staff there is great! Very friendly and warm! The extended office hours were great and convenient. I was able to go to my therapy after work, so I didn't have to take any time off. I highly recommend this office and will definitely choose them again if I need PT."
I love coming to this Benchmark Physical Therapy. The people are friendly and Scott is the best. I feel very comfortable at this facility and recommend it to others.
"I have been going to PT for about 3 months following a car accident. The professional care I have received has been nothing short of amazing. From my PT (Scott) to all the staff they have worked as a team to get me on the road to recovery. I have gained a lot from Scott's ability and education of dry needling and cupping and I have recommend this for anyone that had my type of injuries. My journey at BenchMark will come to a bitter sweet end soon, but I will never forget the care, attention and friendships I have obtained from this particular facility. To try and recite a quote I know, "" It's easy to make a buck, it's a lot tougher to make a difference."" Scott and the staff have truly made a difference in my life by giving me back my life PAIN FREE!"
"Very friendly, listen to you and target where you need the most work"
Took great care of me. Definitely recommend.
I had a bad car accident in November. Scott and the entire staff were excellent and made sure it was a comfortable experience for me! I have improved greatly and I am so happy my lawyer referred me here! 5 star experience!
"I think Benchmark on
Tobacco road Augusta is professional and very personal in there service
Thank you Aubrey and the staff for all your help in Getting me feeling better about balance and movement
Thanks Randee Kaage
‚ñ™"
"What a wonderful experience here at Benchmark therapy! Scott, Kilani and Aubrey are the best. I received excellent care! Everyone is exceptionally nice and knowledgeable..The atmosphere is relaxing and healing. I will always come back for any issues I may have in the future (praying none!). If you‚Äôre in the CSRA area in need of physical therapy this location is where to go! They actually care about their patients and go above and beyond!"
My experience at benchmark was very rewarding in so many ways. I'm so thankful for the physical therapy that I received. I'm on the path to recovery one step at a time and for that I'm forever grateful. I will highly recommend anyone to benchmark that in need of therapy. AW
I had a neck injury and I was completely locked up and it was getting worse. Scott and the staff took it very serious and worked so hard to solve the problem. They went above and beyond and slowly but surely my injury not only improved but is better than it's been in years. I am truly grateful and very pleased with my experience with the Tobacco rd Benchmark team!
"In August 2019 I was involved in a horrific rollover MVA, and referred to this location.  The employees at this  establishment have become like family. When you enter the door you are greeted warmly and this continues as you begin your services. Everyone from the Physical Therapist, Assistant PT, Administration, and staff are beyond helpful and encouraging. The staff will demonstrate each applicable exercise and provide a print out to further your progress at home. Plus you may get a cup of Joe and a  Krispy Kreme donut or 2 :))"
Very friendly and professional
My experience at BenchMark PT was great!! Scott is a great therapist. Other staff is great as well!!

They are magical



My experience at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Norcross was excellent!! I feel100% better than when I started therapy.I am able to resume the activities I couldn't do before therapy. I couldn't do anything around my house or even enjoy sitting at a table having coffee with a friend. I now enjoy those activities more than ever! My therapist Brian Cheddar was professional and personable. I highly recommend him and all the staff at Benchmark Physical Therapy!
The best staff. Great environment. Highly recommended.
I went here a few months ago and everything was very professional.
"Excellent service!!! Their staffs are super nice and professional. I have been struggling with my neck for a quite long time. After seeing benchmark, I feel a lot better. Highly recommended!"
"Ariane Robinson is fantastic!! Very knowledgeable, highly effective, and a great personality. The entire staff is clearly dedicated to customer service.  So convenient and easy to work with."
"The therapists are genuinely NICE people that are well educated in this field. They somehow made working out fun for me. I would recommend this location to anyone in need of physical therapy! Robert, Maggie, Elliott, Brent and Ariane THANK YOU SO MUCH.... you guys are amazing!"
I went here for 3 months to recover from shoulder surgery. The people that worked with me were all really nice and professional. It was a good experience and definitely helped me get back to normal after the surgery. üëç
The therapists and staff at BenchMark Physical Therapy are  INCREDIBLE!  I am a mother of 2 kids and a group fitness instructor with chronic back & neck pain.  The BenchMark team have been so patient with me as we figured out the source of my pain and the best way to get me back on my feet and enjoying my very busy/active life.  I am SO GRATEFUL for compassionate and professional support.
"Robert and the other physical therapists have been absolutely amazing.  I herniated my disc and had burning pain and numbness going down my left leg.  It affected everything. It made walking difficult and it was becoming increasingly impossible for me to sleep with the pain.  I did not realize how helpful physical therapy could be before coming but now I'm a believer in physical therapy for painful injuries!! Robert has been very professional, timely, and knowledgeable.  If you need physical therapy, I HIGHLY recommend Robert at Benchmark's Norcross, GA location!!!"
Staff is very professional and friendly. They listen closely to how you feel and adjust treatment according to need. I called twice to reschedule and cancel appointments and both times they were very kind and patient with me. 10/10 would recommend!
"Highly recommend this place to anyone who needs physical therapy! I've been to physical therapy before, but this was my first time with Benchmark and definitely preferred them. They got me feeling as good as new! The therapists at Norcross are super friendly and knowledgable. And make sure you say hi to Kristen! She helped me with my exercises, while also making therapy fun!"
"This place is awesome! Maggie, Christen, Juliano, Kim, etc. are consummate professionals who really know what they‚Äôre doing. Thank you for helping me get my shoulder back to a good baseline!"
"I‚Äôve gone to physical therapy for months now and every day has been beneficial to my body aches and pains after my car accident. Robert was my goto physical therapist and he has been phenomenal in helping me get back to normal.
The rest of the staff is great. Loved Kim at the front desk and all the techs as well like Brett, Kristen and Juliano."
"The staff is amazing. They encourage you when needed. If I never need physical therapy, this will absolutely be the first place I'm coming to hands down. They do dry needling, cupping, and various other methods as well."
Truly care about your well being
"Went to them for an old tennis wrist injury... was back on the court within weeks, playing like it never happened... and I was ready to just play in pain with a brace! Such amazing work and a fun atmosphere!"
Maggie the Magnificent!  I recovered and discharged quickly cause Maggie & team are incredible...
"After knee surgery, the staff, Maggie, Robert, Juliano, and all the rest helped me get back to full mobility. Would highly recommend"
"Great hands on staff, flexible hours. Impressed with the pain relief I've received. Take a chance on dry needling. Mixed in with standard PT treatment has made a difference in how I feel day to day. Thanks guys (Raakhee, Kristina, Alan....)"
"The team at Benchmark-Norcross is amazing.  I was in a car accident three months ago and it was a very hard time for me. Rockhee, Kristina, and Allen have become like a second home. The environment here is so fun. They are supportive, comforting, encouraging and they helped me believe in myself when I didn't have the strength to!  They will push you and fight for you to get back on your feet! They are the best and I will miss them so much!"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE the staff ‚ù§
Clean area"
The therapists and staff  at the Peachtree Corners Benchmark are very efficient and knowledgeable!

Comfortable waiting room and friendly staff




"I am so appreciative for the fact that Eric took the time to explain what was the root of my neck problems. He immediately got to work on problem areas and for the first time in nine years I am starting to get neck relief.  Although I have just started therapy,  I know I am at the right place and in good hands.  Matt is the first person I met and a great ambassador for the office.  He also works on me as well.  Thank you,  Jan N."
Thanks to the awesome team at ATI for doing a great job helping me with PT & recovery from surgery!
Very professional. Great group who know what they are doing. Highly recommend
"Because of both knee and leg problems, I have been a client at ATI for several months on separate occasions. I have never been disappointed with the treatment provided for me.  Cannot say enough about the professionalism, the enthusiasm and support shown by Patrick and Eric. Their commitment to their clients is top-notch."
Had shoulder replacement and did therapy at ATI in Vestavia. Patrick Prewitt was my main therapist and he was outstanding. Treated me with respect and was very professional. I highly recommend ATI!
Good experience. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Eric explained the procedures well.
"I had hip replacement surgery 4/6. Today‚Äôs 4/15 & literally have no pain. I used walker for only 1 week.
I attribute this to my PT, Eric. He‚Äô hasn‚Äôt pushed me too hard & made it enjoyable."
"My experience has been great, very personal and intentional!!"
"Professional, knowledgeable, caring therapists! I have used ATI Vestavia for a few issues and have always had wonderful results. Thank you Eric!"
Much farther along than I anticipated after my total knee replacement. It has been 4 weeks and I‚Äôm already walking better than I have in years. Not easy but it has been worth the effort!  Thank you ATI and Erick.
ATI got me back to enjoying what I enjoy doing in a great atmosphere.  The staff was great and I recommend anyone to get healthy at the Vestavia location.
Everyone was awesome
ATI Vestavia Hills is AWESOME!   All of the therapists truly care about their patients and want them to get back to normal life/activities.  I have known Eric Booth the longest as he has helped me through several injuries over the last 4 years.  He believes in helping patients get back to their normal & often better fitness levels.   I really appreciate all that ATI has helped me achieve!   Thanks Eric!
The staff at ATI Physical Therapy- Vestavia has been great to work with. They are very knowledgeable and enjoy helping people get back ‚Äòon their feet‚Äô. Eric Booth has gone above and beyond trying to help rehab my knee. He truly cares for the health of his clients.
"The facility has plenty of room and is full of up to date equipment.  From the receptionist to the therapists, everyone is so helpful and they work so hard to make you feel better. Don‚Äôt waste your time going to other places. These folks are the best in the business."
"Very pleased with my progress after just my first visit! A torn meniscus had me barely able to walk, but I left my first session with Patrick able to walk normally, though carefully. Thank you ATI!"
"I love this place!!! When I went in, I had so much pain in my lower back!  Not only was Eric able to tell me why it was hurting, he helped me fix it.  I feel like a new person.  Everyone that works there is so kind and welcoming.  They all cared about who they were helping.  I‚Äôm gonna miss that bunch!! If you ever need any sort of physical therapy, go to the Vestavia location!!!! They are the best!!!"
"The staff at ATI Vestavia Hills are exceptional. They are friendly, encouraging, helpful, and go above and beyond to do what they can. They are very patient-centered focused, accommodating with scheduling, and have helped me get back to normal daily activities. They have exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend them to anyone."
"The whole clinic staff in Vestavia is friendly, helpful, and caring. They always greet you with a smile and care about you! The therapist genuinely care about you and want the best for you! They helped me get back to my previous activity and made sure to get me back to the level of activity that I was at before!"
The professional staff at ATI in Vestavia Hills have helped me in my recovery from knee surgery and subsequently a serious foot injury.  They have gone above and beyond to be sure I get the best possible treatment and results.  I am very grateful to everyone on staff.
Really nice and friendly staff. Makes you feel at home. Would recommend for anyone who needs pt.

I had hip replacement went to Benchmark Stockbridge was 100% pleased. Would recommend this group to anyone needing PT there are the best
Excellent care and practice is done here.  The staff is knowledgeable and personable!  Alan is so smart and has an excellent skill set.  A true gifted professional.  So thankful for the help and healing that they provided.  Highly recommend them!
"I was involved in an auto accident September 2019. My left shoulder was in so much pain that I couldn't do normal activities or even work without pain shooting down my arm and up into my neck. I was referred to Benchmark for physically therapy. The staff there are very knowledgeable and gave me stretches and exercises that targeted specific areas to decrease the inflammation. They are also very friendly and make you feel comfortable while you are there. After just 6 sessions, my shoulder is completely pain free! I am extremely impressed and satisfied with Benchmark and HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who needs physically therapy."
"The Benchmark team is excellent! Everyone from the knowledgeable front office staff to the therapy team, truly work together to provide great customer service! I called several therapy clinics before making my appointment. Katie was by far the most pleasant and knowledgeable, which made BenchMark my location of choice. My primary therapists were Alan and Anthony, however I can honestly say that it was a team effort. Whether it was Holly jumping in to assist with my therapy needs or Patrick, Sierra and Wanda providing additional moral support, THIS TEAM ROCKS!! I highly recommend this clinic for your physical therapy needs!!"
This was my first experience with physical therapy and I was a little nervous as well as doubtful of its effectiveness. My first interaction with Benchmark was during the appointment setting process with Katie. She was professional and personable. Sierra was great also and very attentive. The therapists (Patrick and Anthony) were extremely knowledgeable and caring. They were both dedicated to helping me reach my health goal. I'm feeling great and I'm so thankful for the greatest staff ever and everything they've done!
"This place is awesome!  Alan Hoffman is the Clinic Director and has hospitality plus!  Everyone that walks in the door he makes feel comfortable!  He's very attentive and wants you to be pain-free or able to tolerate your pain, better than when you walked in the door!  The staff is great too!  Katy at the front desk is a gem!  She always has a ready smile! If you need PT...go here!!! God Bless Y'all!!!"
"Staff is personable and friendly. Great experience overall. All of the physical therapist are very knowledgeable and will get you to where you need to be. Front office staff are wonderful. They listen and understand your problems. Great, awesome, fantastic, and phenomenal experience with rehabilitation my shoulder at Benchmark. I recomend them to family and friends all the time."
"Benchmark PT in Stockbridge is the best!!!! Alan H. was my therapist and he was great. He is very professional and knowledgeable. He made me feel comfortable from day one of my services. I really think all of the therapists in this office are great. You can't go wrong with nether. I would like to think Anthony also for working with me when Alan was unable to. The girls in the front office was very nice. Overall, I would go back to this office in a heartbeat if needed. Keep up the good work guys!!!"
The staff at BenchMark  Physical Therapy are wonderful. My Therapist Alan was wonderful always pushed me and stayed on me about getting out the house. My exercise was what I needed to build my strength back up in my knee and they are doable at home for the most part. Very friendly environment all the therapist talk to you and tell on you if your not doing it right hahaha. Overall I went in hurting came out laughing and walking very well thank you guys by the way this is  Tina aka redhead towel lady‚ò∫üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"Awesome service and Great staff from the front desk through out facility. Philip I want to thank u for being patient with me during my painful sessions  at the beginning. I luv the team spirit atomopher both me and my Son receive outstanding care. .I am not pain free but 80% better than the day I walked in. Thank u, Thank u Wings in meüòé"
"I have significant issues from injuries I sustained while on active duty. I have used Bench Mark  physical therapy since being stationed in Georgia in 1998. They have kept me mobile and active which I am very grateful for. When I find myself in pain that I can't manage myself, I go back and get the same effective treatment and wonderful customer service each time. When I go it's like going home. Now I know most people may find it strange to feel that way about someplace you hope you only need once BUT, when you know you will never be pain free, it's a beautiful thing to be able to walk into a place where people automatically treat you like family, they know what you are feeling is not all in your head because the doctors can't see it on an x-ray, and when you walk out the door, you are ready to get on with your day.

Ms. Wanda has been there from day one. She is the first and last person you see, most days, when you walk in the door. You couldn't ask for a more welcoming and efficient beginning and end to your visit.

Allen was my therapist this time around. He is an Awesome therapist and person. He knew exactly which techniques to use for me and my issues and, although you may not feel so great right away, if you are consistent and learn the work you need to do to help make yourself better, you will leave better than you came. He is a very down to earth person as well, and fun to be around. Trust me, that matters when you are in pain.

Phillip, Katie and the rest of the staff are wonderful people too. They all work together to make this Bench Mark office a place you can safely and confidently come to and get/keep your body moving. OK!!! I'm off my soap box \ :-)"
I went for physical therapy at this location for help with a pinched nerve/herniated disc.  Dr. Alan Hofman was great to work with.  He challenged and encouraged me through the healing process.  I was impressed with the cleanliness of the facility and the friendliness of the entire staff.
"My experience with benchmark was great! They ask for my goals on my first visit and helped me achieve that goal! That team is nothing short of awesome.

Thanks for everything!
Gloria B."
Benchmark Physical Therapy in Stockbridge feels more like a gym than a medical facility which is awesome. Just finished the second time I needed physical therapy and Alan was my therapist both times. He reviews your specific therapy needs and encourages you through each exercise. I would definitely recommend this facility!
Patrick is a wonderful therapist and very knowledgeable.  This was my first experience with physical therapy and I felt very comfortable and welcomed.  Katie at the front desk was always pleasant and I appreciated how she always greeted me by name.  I highly recommend this location.
"If you ever in the need of help recovering from an injury I would like to point you in the direction of Benchmark Physical Therapy. I was having a lot of trouble with my left shoulder and they were very effective in guiding me to the 6-week road to recovery. They were firm, however they a very personable people. So I would like to thank Allan, Anthony, Philip, Katelyn (hope I spelled that correctly) and the rest of the staff for helping me out and helping me to understand the process. I never knew you could get a doctorate in physical therapy and they have them a gang of them running around that place. Which means they've taken the time to study so they can offer their very best to their clients."
"I'd like to thank the highly skilled, professional,  friendly and courteous therapist Philip (Phil) Kennedy and indeed the entire staff at BenchMark Physical Therapy for accompanying me on this road to recovery from my back surgery a couple of months ago. I will definitely use or recommend their services. Thank you!"
"The staff at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Stockbridge has been friendly, courteous and professional throughout my care there. The front office staff responded to scheduling requests in person and by phone promptly and patiently when I would make changes to my schedule. Thank you Wanda and Katie.
Phillip was attentive to my requests and patient with me when needed to overcome a hurdle in my therapy. Thanks for helping me achieve range of motion and strength goals and connecting with our common interests, travel, college football and cooking. Anthony was patient with me when I would get discouraged and encouraged me to keep going with my home exercises. Alan would check with me to make sure I was doing well in the program even after a break in my therapy due to foot surgery.  In summary, each staff member made a ‚Äúpainful‚Äù experience more bearable and successful. I give them five stars and highly recommend them."
"I love this team. They took excellent care of me from beginning to end. Allan , Kaitlin , Wanda, Anthony, Phillip, Kate, and katlyn.  They are very understanding and flexible with scheduling and firm with the treatment. üíØrecommend them. Blessings"
"Just finished 6 weeks at Benchmark Physical Therapy Stockbridge. Allan was an outstanding Therapist, he was very flexible with time but straight forward and stern with treatment. Not just Allan but every member of that branch during my time there was outstanding and great to work with. Thank You."
Absolutely amazing team...all of the PTs and office staff are great. They care about each patient and are very accommodating with your care plan. Definitely recommend!
"Throughout my recent journey with shoulder surgery and recovery I was confident that I had made the right choice for my physical therapy needs by choosing BenchMark at Stockbridge. The entire staff ‚Äì Therapists, Office Staff, and Assistants ‚Äì all did their part to make me comfortable and take care of every need and request.  I observed the entire staff working together as a team for the benefit of all patients. From my initial evaluation through to my last PT session, Philip combined his skill and compassion to bring me through the process which has put me on the road to complete recovery.  Again, big THANK YOU goes out to all of the staff at Bench Mark at Stockbridge!  If you need PT services I highly recommend this location."""
"I have had the greatest experience with my first time going through physical therapy,  I am very appreciative of the care and help I received from Benchmark,  and especially from Phillip,  and  hated when he left. Thanks for all your help and training."
"Short Version: Great staff that actually cares about you, your injury, and your schedule. Patrick and his fellow staff made the highest standard of therapy. No questions asked.

During my visit here, I was introduced to Patrick Corley. Every visit I had for my ankle was personal: he would ask if I had any trouble doing specific activities with my ankle and about my day. His beaming personality and carefulness can assure anyone that he loves what he does. Fellow staff would liven up the place with a bit of conversation to pass the time, it doesn't even feel like you're just there for therapy; everyone was a healthy balance of professional and proactive! They have a wonderful set of equipment to work with, along with challenging exercises to get you back to normal as soon as possible.

I also have to put in a good word for Katie who works at the desk. She was patient with me and my constant schedule changes, and even made it convenient for me to set up appointments earlier in case if I couldn't make it to the later appointment.

I was also given a card to keep in touch, some stretches and exercises I can continue to do at home, and a t-shirt for my ""graduation"" haha.

Would definitely show up here if I need to recover from another injury."
"I had a wonderful experience with Alan. He is an awsome therapist. He listens, understands and gives great advice. The office as a whole provides a very friendly atmosphere from the front office ladies to all the other therapist. I would highly recommend Benchmark, especially Alan."
I highly recommend Benchmark physical therapy. Alan Hoffman and his staff were very knowledgeable and professional in helping me recover after my rotator cuff surgery. And they treated me like family.
"Everyone at Benchmark is great! From the receptionists, who are extremely friendly, to the physical therapists, who are knowledgeable and professional. I would definitely recommend Benchmark if you‚Äôre looking for a physical therapist."
"My 6 year old son first came to Benchmark after his cast had been removed from a fractured knee.  We didn't know what to expect.  He was in a lot of pain and didn't really want to use his leg at all.  Alan and the staff were very patient and professional with him.  They encouraged and challenged him.  This allowed my son to thrive!!  We along with his doctor were amazed by his rapid progress.  My family was always welcomed with a family friendly atmosphere and a courteous staff.  I am eternally grateful to Alan and the staff at Benchmark because my son had been referred to CHOA but they refused to accept him because they didn't have equipment for his size!  They referred us to another CHOA in the next county and gave us an appointment 3 weeks out!  Benchmark gave us an appointment that very day!!! I thank God it worked out this way because I am convinced we received the absolute best care for our son and just in time for the soccer season!  My son's goal was to be well enough to play soccer and thanks to Alan and the staff he reached his goal!!  I will recommend to friend, family, and everyone to go to Benchmark for any of their physical therapy needs!!"
"I went to Benchmark to treat my heel pain as a referral from my Podiatrist. I saw Alan H. as my therapist. He performed dry needling on the affected areas and had me do stretching and exercises to focus on the heel and surrounding muscles to strengthen and build stability. Alan was great with me and all the other patients as he was very at tentative and personable with each person. The service was great from the time you walk in and Katie greets you and signs you in, to Alan and the rest of the staff. They all interacted with each others patients and quite often a friendly discussion of food or some other general topic would break out. Thus was my first experience with physical therapy and it was much better than I thought it would be. I went for about 2 months and cleared my heel pain, which I waited for almost a year to get looked at. I would recommend Benchmark to anyone looking for a personalized physical therapy/rehab!"
"Great experience! Comfortable environment, friendly staff. Alan is a great PT! Would recommend this location to anyone."
Stellar customer service! Amazing physical therapists on staff. They are truly miracle workers!
"My mother fell last year, fracturing her wrist, as well as injuring her back, hip, and shoulder. She recovered from her wrist fracture nicely, however, her back, hips and shoulder continued to cause her pain and aggravation. Her primary care physician referred her to BPT for help with her symptoms.

Alan and the staff were courteous, compassionate, and professional. My mom responded well to the therapy and is much better today. If you want excellent care. this is the place to be."
"I went to BenchMark PT in Stockbridge for neck/upper back care after an accident. Before my first appointment I was unable to move my neck around for simple tasks such as driving, sleeping, sitting at my desk for extended periods, etc. After a few weeks of working with Philip K., my range of motion improved greatly. My pain was gone and my neck/upper back were strengthened better than it was before the accident. Therapy works when doing it with the right people. Try BenchMark in Stockbridge!!!"
Philip and the staff at Benchmark are awesome. Very professional.  Thank you for helping me to get my knee back in shape.
When I went I was pretty torn up however with the help of the torture chamber Patrick & Anthony fixed me right up.  It's days that I disliked going but once I started either Anthony or Patrick made it worth my efforts.  Thanks to them I'm on the mark and ready to go back to swimming.  Thanks from the front office ladies to the back Benchmark Rocks!
Before coming to Benchmark I had sever tendonitis in my wrist due to an old injury. I was referred to Benchmark and received treatment from Alan. I am so grateful for Alan!! I no longer have pain any more and the stiffness in my wrist is completely gone. I no longer have to take joint or pain medication and I can continue my job as a Dental Assitant in great comfort. The exercises he showed me were easy to remember and I am now able to do them on my own at home. Thank you Benchmark! God bless you Alan!
Benchmark Therapists are all great! My main therapist was Alan but they all shared in to help. My knee has strengthened since going to them.
Great group of professionals and know how to take care of a wide variety of people at different stages of healing. I do recommend them
I went in after breaking my ankle in 4 places thinking i would never walk normally again. Thanks to Anthony and Alan I went for my first visit in a wheelchair and walked out on my own at the last visit. Everyone in the office was great!
Awesome staff and excellent results. Dr. Alan Hofman worked with me in treating some tendonitis issues. I would definitely use them again and they have my highest recommendation.
Great group of therapists here. I had lower back and sciatic pain. Taught me exercises to help strengthen my lower back which has minimized my pain. Would recommend this place to anyone!
Excellent customer service- the therapist were all extremely knowledgeable and very friendly.  Great atmosphere
The front staff were very friendly and helpful and the therapist was very knowledgeable about correcting all ailments.   Great job everyone.
All of the staff is friendly and nice. They really helped me get back to feeling 100% myself.
Great experience here with physical therapy.  Alan was the best!
"I  wished I could give the staff at Benchmark in Stockbridge more than 5 stars! I just finished up my PT today and I cannot tell you how much Patrick has helped me. Patrick was my therapist and is excellent at his job. I have gone to physical therapy numerous times in the past and while I did experience improvement at other places, it was nothing like at Benchmark!

The first day I went to the office, I remember sitting in the reception area thinking about how embarrassing it was going to be for me  to tell my therapist about all of my medical conditions since I am after all only 50 years old. And for someone my age to have all of the pain issues that I encounter on a daily basis is almost unheard of, but never once did Patrick make me feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. He always listened and is very intuitive and learned very quickly how to read me and my facial expressions. I started PT back in April 2017 for numerous physical challenges, especially for my back, neck and feet and really didn't know what to expect based on past experience, but it didn't take long to discover that I was in the right place. While Patrick was my primary therapist, I also worked with Anthony on occasion who is also very good. And since I was a patient for a while, I was also able to observe the rest of the staff. And, I can honestly say that I have never met a friendlier or more knowledgeable staff. Never once did I ever feel awkward, especially in the beginning, unlike other places or doctors offices. They truly are the best at what they do!

Take my word for it, I have been in more than my share of doctors offices in my lifetime and I don't brag unless you have earned it and this place truly did. By the time that I finished today, I didn't look at Alan (the clinic manager), Patrick, Anthony, Phillip, Katie or Wanda as a patient provider but as my friends! I will definitely go back when the need arises and recommend this office to anyone needing PT. Thank you to each and everyone at Benchmark in Stockbridge, especially Patrick."
The staff is friendly and helpful! I really enjoyed their service!
"The staff at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Stockbridge is the best! I had a torn achilles tendon (one doctor wanted to do surgery) when I went to Benchmark. Alan Hoffman, and Anthony Glenn worked with me diligently for more than a month, pushing me to reach my goals but in a very kind and caring way. The rest of the staff - from the reception desk to the intern Caitlyn - was professional and attentive. The atmosphere was upbeat and very inviting and put me at ease.  I looked forward to my twice-a-week sessions and in fact miss the staff every day now. I would highly recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy in Stockbridge. What a great team!!!!"
"This was about my third time getting PT services from Benchmark (Stockbridge). As always, they were very helpful and provided excellent healthcare. The healthcare and administrative staff worked with me around my work schedule to ensure that I received the proper care at the right time. I recommend them for any future therapy services."
Holly is amazing! I never thought of going to physical therapy for my vertigo but I'm glad my doctor recommended it.
This is a great clinic with awesome therapists. I had horrible neck pain when I came in and with each visit my neck pain improved and now I am pain free!
Benchmark Physical therapist are very professional and knowledgeable. They worked with me to regain the ability to function with my day to day activities.
Awesome place great staff front and back.  üòÉ
Everyone is extremely nice and has a great atmosphere!
The best physical therapy
Great people


"Not good experience. They do not give you any specifics about charges. I was told a session will cost approx. $120, when I received the bill, they had charged more than $200. They never explained that they will charge by the time. The PT would ask me to do an exercise 20 times, or 40 times and work with other patients--never saying that more time will mean more $$s. Also, I did not ask for a massage, the PT never asked me whether I wanted one and he charged me $60 for a less than 5 min massage. Total rip-off. Be warned, there is no way you can dispute their bill."
"I really don‚Äôt even want to give it one star. Worst experience I have ever had at any medical facility. Pamela G. was apathetic, discouraging, and very unprofessional. Her negativity radiated throughout the session and she even insulted orthopedic surgeons. She hardly spent any time with me during exercises. Please do not waste your time. I left feeling very discouraged."
"I came here to address my lower back pain after doctor recommendation, and I left after a few months of work with the techniques to manage my pain. I often looked forward to the sessions. Thanks, Pamela."



"The genuine care and concern that I received @ Benchmark Tucker, motivated me to continue with the exercises and treatments.
In a brief 2 weeks, Jess, Ross and the team got my plantar under control allowing me to get back to the long walks that I desperately missed.
Thanks to all for your excellent treatments.
Bob Albrecht"
Ross is amazing and the staff are so supportive. I'm grateful to have such a great experience so near me. They go above and beyond!!!
Referred by my Dr. Started therapy for back issues. My P. T. may be petite but the greatest. Only issue is they're in need of comfortable and more attractive chairs.
"Ross and his team are absolutely phenomenal!!  I am currently being treated for an old back injury that‚Äôs flaring, and I‚Äôm already seeing improvement after only two and a half weeks of therapy. They are kind, compassionate and professional in every way. Today, after my visit, I realized that I got the time of my appointment mixed up. I inadvertently showed up two hours early, but they never missed a beat and accommodated me at the time I arrived. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about them! They are simply the best!!!"
"The team at Tucker Benchmark Physical Therapy was so supportive to ensure I reached my goal of strengthening my shoulder. It was very challenging at times, but the outcome was worth it, and I am able to do everyday task without the  pain I had previously experienced.  A special thanks to my P.T. Dominique, and  assistant Sarah. I highly recommend this location. Also,Thanks goes to Ross the Clinic Director."
Dr. Ross treated my foot pain. He is very knowledgeable and talented professional. He gave me lot of confidence and strength to get through my pain. The entire staff is awesome. I highly recommend Dr.Ross.
"Laura Schirmer and the whole staff are really caring professionals. She worked with me over a month to strengthen the muscles around my knees and hips and developed a plan for me to continue working at home. Hopefully, I will be able to delay any knee surgery and keep my knees from hurting as much as they have in the past."
"This my 2nd time coming to this Benchmark location over the past few years. Being located in a small shopping center makes it so accessible, way better than navigating large medical centers, and walking so far to get to your facility. Parking is easy and free too.
The staff is great! Friendly, highly knowledgeable, and professional. It was like that a few years ago too.
And finally, I went in last April with severe shoulder pain and unable to do simple tasks. Now I am pain free, no meds necessary and I have gained all the skills to hopefully stay that way."
"Very pleasant experience. Staff is friendly, accommodating and professional. Exceptional care."
"Started with Domonique back in December for therapy. She is very knowledgeable, caring, and most of all very comforting. I have been having such a hard time with getting my issue better. There have been times when I wanted to just give up but seeing her makes me feel better and encouraged each time. Ross & Sarah are also very nice and caring. And not to forget Laura...Everyone at this location seems to have so much compassion in what they do. The place is very clean and the follow COVID guidelines. If you are looking for a physical therapist I would highly recommend this location. Kudos to each and every one of youüíô"
"Everyone was very pleasant, the therapists are very knowledgeable and sensitive. When I came in I could barely walk from pain and instability. I left walking normal, much less pain and with alternatives for controlling pain"
"The staff at Benchmark PT was great. They were all professional and very friendly.  My therapist was Jessica. She was very knowledgeable, responded to all of my questions, and provided a variety of exercises and stretches that addressed my pain and discomfort. She, along with Ross Dockter (PT/Clinic Director), did everything to help me make progress and reach my goals."
"Benchmark Tucker is a remarkably well-run and professional clinic.  The staff are dedicated, compassionate and highly skilled.  They treated me for lower back and vertigo issues.  I was very well pleased with the results and highly recommend Benchmark services."
"I received  quality physical therapy for the last few months.  It was completely beneficial and provided me with overall improvement for my spine and lower extremities. Every session increased by mobility more and more. The staff were friendly warm, patient and compassionate. I would recommend office for anyone looking for physical therapy."
Ross Dockter and the staff at Benchmark were great. They are always encouraging and they push you to make more progress at every session. PT is a collaborative effort between the patient and the therapist and they push you to get better. The atmosphere is not clinical which makes it comfortable for the patient. They do a great job fighting against COVID-19 and all viruses by cleaning each piece of equipment after every use. It was a great and beneficial experience.
"I had the need for physical therapy and was fortunate to get it at Benchmark Tucker, GA. They went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and regain the level of mobility that I wanted. Many thanks to my therapist ‚ÄúLaura‚Äù @ her assistant ‚ÄúSahra‚Äù. The office staff is always willing to help and very friendly. Thank You all"
"I cannot say enough wonderful things about BenchMark PT in Tucker, GA.  Over the past 2 years I  required PT for rotator cuff surgery and most recently post tibial tendonitis.  I had a different therapist each visit, and both were very personable and caring.  Raakee Patel and Ross Dockter were always  professional, very knowledgeable in the details and implementation of my PT for each issue,  very clear in their directions and very encouraging on those tough days when you wonder if you will heal and have full-range of motion. The team at the front desk is also excellent, always welcoming you with a smile, taking your temp., and very helpful with scheduling and payments.  There is also no reason for concerns about the COVID-19 protocol at BenchMark PT, Tucker, GA.  The entire team at BenchMark PT in Tucker takes their responsibility for each client's health safety as well as physical safety to heart.  If you are in need of physical therapy, BenchMark PT in Tucker, GA is the place you want to be."
"This is my second time using BenchMark for physical therapy and both with Laura.  Atmosphere is relaxed, talkative, and fun, but always professional and focused.  Highly recommend Laura and the BenchMark group."
"Professional, knowledgeable, and friendly Physical Therapists and staff at this location.My doctor prescribed a couple months PT (twice weekly for a month, then once a week for a month) after a sudden onset of pretty debilitating hip pain and back pain/sciatica didn't resolve after a month of rest and inactivity. I had been quite active for my age (67) playing pickleball and golf weekly up to the point of the sudden onset of pain and limited mobility. Therapist Ross Dockter handled 90+% of my physical therapy visits, which consisted primarily of targeted exercises for core & back strength and leg & hip/back flexibility, along with massage of problem areas. Ross listened to get a good understanding of my history and complaints, then devised a therapy regimen that greatly relieved almost all of the pain and discomfort I was experiencing when I started PT. After finishing my last session today, I feel like all of the severe pain I was feeling initially is gone. I am left with a small amount of soreness and referred leg pain off and on at times when I sit for a long period, but with activity or by doing the exercises prescribed at home by the therapists, any minor pain is short-lived. I am hopeful that by continuing the core-strengthening exercises they provided me, the small issues I have left will also soon be gone.  I've been able to resume my regular exercise routine of playing pickleball and golf during the course of my treatment, and was pleased I could rake leaves for hours a couple times as well without pain. I have normal muscle soreness after hours of exercise or leaf-raking, but the nerve pain and stiffness that made simply walking up my driveway or a flight of stairs quite painful is almost completely gone. I am pleased to highly recommend Ross and Laura and the staff of the Tucker Benchmark Therapy location."
I‚Äôve always had the best therapists here. Dominique was amazing treating my severe neck pain. Rest of staff is very friendly and professional. Highly recommend
"There are a lot of physical therapy businesses in this city, but I am so glad to have chosen Benchmark on Hugh Howell Road. Laura Schirmer and Ross Dockter are amazing therapists. They both are confident in their skill set, professional, and they are kind to all their patients. I feel stronger after every therapy session."
We were referred to Benchmark Physical therapy after my son broke his ankle and had surgery.  We felt like family the whole time.  My son loved the laid back atmosphere and really connected with his therapist.  He made a lot of progress and is walking much better now.  I would highly recommend this facility to anyone in need of physical therapy.
"I went to BenchMark Physical Therapy about five weeks ago because I was having pain in my right knee and having trouble walking and doing other activities.  My therapist was Domonique Beckhan and she was great from the beginning. She is patient and takes the time to explain everything so that I can understand what she was doing.  She made me feel that we were in it together to make sure that I got back to health.  All the other therapists were so sweet and caring too, the enviroment made you feel safe and cared for.  I would always be thankful to Domonique for  my care and the tips she gave me to ensure that I can take care of myself always.  Thanks BenchMark you got a Gold Star for excellence."
"The staff, environment, patient experience and convenience of Benchmark in Tucker are all top notch. Laura is so fresh, caring and professional, and I looked forward to each visit. I was miserable when I began and she improved my walking time 7 times. Because of Laura's success and inspiration, I decided to continue a monthly program at the facility to stay on top of my hip issues."
"The team here is fantastic. I would highly recommend going to this location for any PT needs. The staff was always kind, understanding, and listened carefully to my personal goals to help me improve. Special shoutout to Laura for being amazing. Thank you!!"
"I would highly recommend going to Benchmark Physical Therapy. I came to Benchmark after tearing my ACL and having surgery on June, 4th of 2019. The team staff at Benchmark physical therapy is so kind, caring and compassionate. I  was at Physical Therapy for 8 months desperately trying to play lacrosse in the upcoming year. I would especially love to thank my physical therapist, Laura Ma‚Äôam, for helping me throughout my journey. Laura had given me hope throughout my whole journey and helped me get stronger day by day. She always encouraged me to do better and was the reason I recovered so fast. I just want to thank Laura Ma‚Äôam and staff for helping me achieve my goals and pushing me to succeed. All of you guys are like family and I can‚Äôt wait to invite all of you guys for my first lacrosse game! Thanks"
"Fantastic. Timely. Friendly. Helped me to do what I needed to do to get my body back where it needed to be. LOVED Dom. She knew exactly what to do, but made each visit fun."
"When I began seeing Alex Beebe at Benchmark PT, I felt hopeless. My problem had gone on so long without resolution but Alex listened to my issues, was creative and willing to change course, if needed.

Alex used all of the tools in his toolbox to ensure I met my goals. He‚Äôs a great teacher, preparing me to leave the nest and fly on my own. Alex is knowledgeable; a professional that empowers his patients to overcome obstacles.

Thank you Alex for helping me get back to my prior exercise abilities."
Alex and the Team did such a great job getting me from a walker back to jogging. They are very conscientious and listen to your needs. They push you but only as hard as you want. I would highly recommend!
"Great experience from start to finish. Overall the location environment is energetic while still remaining professional. My physical therapy sessions were with Domonique Beckham, PT, DPT. However, there were opportunities in to observe the other physical therapists with their patients as well and my perceptions are they would also provide excellent care. Domonique was professional and really pushed me in coming back from my injury. She was tough but kind (even when I was not being my best self). I‚Äôm planning to do my exercises and hoping not to need PT in the future. In the event that I did - I would most certainly choose Benchmark Physical Therapy Tucker again."
"The Tucker location has always had first rate therapists, and have always provided excellent care in a pleasant environment.  But with Ross as Clinic Director, the atmosphere is even more comfortable.  Everyone helps everyone, everyone laughs, and everyone works...HARD.  The office staff under Kenesha Dixon's tutelage is always on top of things; nothing gets by the woman!   Asst. Coordinator Brenda and PT Techs Nik and David also were wonderful, as were Dominique and Laura, the other PTs on site.  This always will be my go-to site for PT."
"My therapist, Laura, was excellent and helped me gain range of motion and strength in my broken shoulder. Everyone at Benchmark Tucker is wonderful and truly dedicated to great patient outcomes. Highly recommend."
"This is an excellent place where the patient is the center of the experience. I was very impressed with the caliber of my Physical Therapist, Domonique Beckham. I was able to make significant progress with balance and movement as I adjust to Peripheral Neuropathy."
"Domonique Beckman was my physical therapist for my 12 sessions at BenchMark (Tucker, Georgia location) and she was excellent.  I found her to be extremely knowledgeable and conscientious.  The exercises she provided have really strengthened my back.   Beyond the exercises Domonique also provided exercises to strengthen my wrists and a great suggestion to avoid the uncomfortableness I feel when I work at my computer for a long time.  On my last day, she made sure I had no questions about how to continue doing the exercises and grouped all them under one access code so I could easily find them.  ‚ÄúGreat job ... Domonique!‚Äù"
"I will recommend this to all my friends and family. I have been suffering with severe headaches for many years, after 4 visits I became headache free. When I started I was getting 2 a week. They are very caring and friendly there. They are the best."


"My orthopedic specialist referred me to this office to help me manage degenerative disc disease pain in my lower back. I found the therapists here outstanding in their care, professionalism, and  treatments. They answered a lot of questions I had about my disease and tailored the treatments to help me manage the  muscle tightness and pain associated with this condition. Most of all, l appreciated their constant encouragements as they saw improvement in my walking and balance. I was amazed myself! Patients do have to work their programs at home if they want to heal, but the caring and encouragements of this staff really helped in my healing. I continue working hard on my program at home but I actually miss going there! Kudos to Erin, Jessica, Stephanie, and Alex!"
"The lady of the desk is sharp and rough, She never has available appointments for me.
I think the person who works in front of a desk should be always more courteous.
The therapist are very friendly üòç"
"BenchMark (Johns Creek) Location is the BEST!
I started the therapies 8 months ago and I got there with back problems and with the frozen shoulder (both).
I have no words to THANK the team Erin, Jessica, Matt and Ariel for all they did for me (All of them very friendly).
Today I can move my arms almost 100% and my back is almost 100% recovered as well.
I highly recommend this place!
I will miss you !!"
"I came here after a major surgery on my right ankle. I wasn‚Äôt able to walk and any type of movement was excruciating. After my first month under Erin‚Äôs care, I was able to start getting around on my own. And now, completing my 3rd month, am am able to do almost everything painlessly. Thank you so much Benchmark! You made physical therapy fun!!"
"Bench Mark is the best! Jessica is a very caring and wonderful therapist and helped me tremendously to ease my hip pain. I can't say enough positive things about Jessica and   Erica, Matt, and Ariel.  They are all great!"
"Erin is terrific, developing a solid plan, keeping the PT sessions upbeat and documenting my improvement. She also listens, a skill too often in short supply. Matt and the rest of the staff I met are top-notch: professional and engaging. A completely positive experience."
"Had a very positive experience with my therapist  Erin,  at Benchmark in Johns Creek.  She was very knowledgeable and kept me on track.  The sessions were properly timed, appropriate and beneficial.  She was very professional and offered suggestions to expedite my recovery from arthroscopic knee surgery.  The assistant staff members were all courteous and made my encounters pleasant.  They were all observant of Covid -19 precautions.  I would highly recommend their services if you are in need of a competent, caring physical therapy group."
"Everyone at this facility is super nice and very warm.  Erin was my therapist and her bedside manner is spectacular.  She knows what she's doing, displays passion and warm enthusiasm, but best of all, she enjoys humor, mostly in the form of bad dad jokes.  Just an overall positive experience, and I literally walked away healed up after 4 weeks.  Ariel the receptionist is great as well, super friendly."
"Erin, Jessica, Matt, and Ariel are a fantastic team!  They perform their individual responsibilities with knowledge, compassion professionalism, and a refreshing sense of humor. They truly care about getting you healthy. Thank you, Erin!"
"Eric runs a very professional establishment and the entire team is super friendly. I was a patient here twice this year and loved it! Erin was my PT both times. She has the perfect bedside manner and truly cares for her patients. She is so easy to talk to and explained the benefits of each exercise she gave me. If you're in need of PT, I highly recommend the Benchmark in Johns Creek!"
Treatment at BenchMark location in Johns Creek has been an unusually positive experience.  Therapist are well trained and skilled in diverse areas of physical therapy.  I am pleased to recommend this particular group of professionals to anyone seeking overall good care who carefully follow physician referrals.
"Did 6 weeks of PT here and was really impressed with the trainers. Aside from being great at their jobs, they had a great culture. Training was made easier with conversations and laughs. Great vibes!!"
Staff is always friendly and professional. They have helped me tremendously!
"excellent service, wonderful knowledgeable  staff, very little waiting time. Listen to you and asking questions about your well being. I felt that the job is done with care.
Thank you Erin and staff."
Jessica and Erin are great therapists.  Best PT experience I‚Äôve had.
"If you are wondering, ‚Äúis this a good place to go for physical therapy,‚Äù don‚Äôt hesitate!!! You definitely will want your PT here. The therapists are really knowledgeable, skillful, professional, and fun to be around. All of the staff is great, the facilities are really clean, and they have flexible hours. They helped me very much in my recovery and I cannot thank them enough."
"I have nothing but great things to say about all the therapists I've encountered here, especially Erin. They take great care, interest, and dedication to your recovery. Definitely a place for healing!"
"I highly recommend Benchmark PT. Both PT‚Äôs (Erin and Jessica) are outstanding.  They are both highly knowledgeable, compassionate and some of the best PT‚Äôs I‚Äôve worked with."
Great staff with positive attitude. Results were terrific. Special thnaks to Jessica for helping me thru it
Great staff: I had the pleasure of working with both of the physical therapists at this location. Both Eric & Erin did an excellent job. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. I always looked forward to my weekly visits.
"From my first visit to my last, Erin and everyone here at Benchmark was supportive and encouraging in my recovery from knee surgery.  The physical therapy process was explained every step of the way and 30 days later I feel stronger than ever.  Thank you for the work you do, Erin!"
"Erin McHugh is an excellent therapist.  I had a pinched nerve in my neck causing modest shoulder pain in daytime and severe pain at night. She treated me using manual therapy techniques supplemented with exercises.  My pain was gone after two sessions. I continued for three more sessions with manual therapy and additional exercises.  She also gave me printed instructions for helpful follow-up home exercises. Ms. McHugh was most congenial, and more importantly, her manual therapy and exercise program were highly effective"
"Saw physical therapist Erin McHugh for shoulder and knee injuries. She was very professional, providing excellent therapeutic evaluation and developing a program that was effective and easily translatable to home use."
"What a year! A sprained ankle and a few months later tennis elbow. Both Erin and Eric at BenchMark Physical Therapy at John‚Äôs Creek were fantastic. Very well trained, professional, and empathetic. I recommend them highly."
"I came to Benchmark after knee replacement surgery and have seen both Eric and Erin.  Both therapists are extremely knowledgeable, professional and compassionate. They have encouraged me to challenge my recovery to improve my strength and mobility.  I am very pleased with the entire staff and would recommend Benchmark Johns Creek to everyone in need of physical therapy.  #happycustomer"
This location was fabulous!  Everyone super friendly.  Erin was my therapist and she was great!   Very easy to work with and explained everything very well.  Would highly recommend.
Eric and his staff are fantastic!! They work hard to treat the issue specifically to the individual. Clinic was immaculate. Super friendly. I got great results. I would not hesitate referring this facility to anyone in need of physical therapy. You definitely enjoy the experience!
I went to the Benchmark facility in Johns Creek for a few months.  I worked with both Eric and Erin.  They were great!!  The exercises they showed me helped a lot and were easy to do at home.  I have been to several PT facilities in this area over the years and this one is the best.
Top notch care from a dedicated staff.  I definitely recommend for anyone in need of PT.
"I have worked with Eric for over 2 years for different issues. During this time he moved his location 3 times and I have moved with him. I find him to be extremely nice, talented and knowledgeable. He has helped me tremendously with all my problems. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about him. In general, I have had a great experience with everyone at Benchmark. I highly recommend."
Erin and the rest of the staff were great! I'm very glad that I went to this location and I will definitely go back again if I ever need to.
"I normally don't write reviews, but I've been going for a month or so and have had nothing but good experiences.  Erik is a knowledgeable and understanding therapist.  Sabrina and Samantha have both been amazing as well.  I've gotten a lot of range back after shattering my wrist completely and being told I might not get much back.  Its a smaller open room environment, but the ratio of therapist to patients never seems to go over 1:2. I've been to several other physical therapists over the years and hated it....and after coming here, I not only feel as though I'm making progress, but I look forward to going each appt."
"This review is a long time coming. Dr. Eric and staff were awesome! Very knowledgeable & attentive. Such a friendly place, beginning with being greeted by Antti! I hope I spelled that correctly LOL!. I was in great hands and believe it or not they make PT fun, because let's face it, no one wants to do PT. Well, you will here! I was in competent hands with Dr. Eric and had the pleasure of also working with Sabrina, who was at this location doing a rotation and is well on her way to becoming a great PT doctor. I was there for knee PT and the work I did at this location besides the exercises given to me to be done at home, certainly helped with the healing process. I would absolutely recommend this location and if I am ever in need of PT again, this is where I would come."
"Wow! I was referred to Eric at Benchmark. I‚Äôve been dealing with chronic shoulder and neck pain for over a year and nobody has been able to solve it.  After my first session with Eric, he uncovered an elevated first rib and sure enough it reversed every single one of my symptoms! I‚Äôm completely blown away and so thankful I was referred to him. Not only is he GREAT at his craft, he‚Äôs an excellent person and just a flowing wealth of knowledge. If there was a six star for above and beyond service I would have clicked that one! I can‚Äôt say enough great things about this place, especially Eric."


"BenchMark Physical Therapy Starr's Mill Location is absolutely the very best physical therapy I have ever received, and I've been an active physical therapy patient for years due to severe back issues.
The entire staff is professional, caring, and they all go above and beyond to include the office manager and any student assistant's they may have shadowing.
I have been seeing Darcey since May of 2021(and I've also seen Alexis who is outstanding), and Darcey has given me my quality of life back in ways I never thought I would experience again.  I am almost pain free and enjoying my life again which I never thought would be possible. I have regained my range of motion in all areas to almost normal and able to do things I haven't done in years.
I simply cannot say enough great things about my entire experience at BenchMark and the passion the staff has for making people better.  It goes beyond their knowledge of the body and how to assist in healing, but it's in their hearts!
I'm so thankful that I chose this location!!"
"BenchMark is by far the best PT that I‚Äôve ever had.  My surgeon recommended them and they did not disappoint.  The staff is excellent, knowledgeable, and encouraging.  My Dr said that I would not regain my original range of motion because of where the three breaks were! I did regain it and in record time.  Another bonus at BenchMark is their custom APP to download for daily exercises at home! It‚Äôs excellent!  A BIG shout  out and thank you to all."
Should anyone be looking for an exceptional physical therapy facility  I can recommend BenchMark as after nine treatment I received as much as 100 percent mobility in the treated area.  They care about their patients and provide outstanding therapy that can on be described as above and beyond the call of duty. Thank you BenchMark Physical Therpy.
"Benchmark PT Peachtree Starr‚Äôs Mill is wonderful!  Darcy is a very skilled therapist and treats her patients with dignity and respect. Everyone in the clinic is very kind, and they work hard to get you to your physical best. I would highly recommend this clinic!"
"Went years ago, and they did a great job.
Going again."
"Melissa and Steven make a great team. Steven is very knowledgeable and treats the issues directly both through specific exercise instruction and hands on therapy. He makes the time spent worthwhile and works hard to improve your situation. Melissa is very pleasant and handles the office responsibilities professionally. She assists Steven with patients when Steven needs her help.
I must also say Melissa does other activities as well. She does the laundry folding of the many pillow cases that are used daily and is the best pillow case folder I ever met. If you need to have heat applied after Steven finishes your therapy you must ask for Melissa to do that task. She has become very efficient.
I would recommend both to anyone needing PT.

Bruce Karen"
I came to Bench mark following 2 cranial surgeries in 1 month.  My core has improved also my balance & strength.  I felt like there was no pressure to get to a certain point in a certain timeline.  Thank you Stephan & Stevie also thanks to Melisa also for working with me on my strange Schedule   Janice  Cater
"By far the best Physical Therapy Place I have been. I am frequent visitor due to an accident and from the moment I stepped in the Barrow office I have been treated with nothing but respect, compassion and kindness. Melissa is always on top of things from appointments to insurance and Stevie ( my therapist) is the most knowledgeable therapist I have met. From basic plans to dry needling to thinking outside the box to help, she does it all. She always answers questions without making you feel like you are bothering her and ALWAYS ALWAYS has an exercise to help with whatever is bothering you. Would highly recommend them!"
"Great staff.  They are friendly, welcoming, and professional. Going to PT can be hard, but they make you want to grow stronger."
"Dedicated, skillful, motivated, motivating. A few words that come to mind.  Stevi is the bestüíØ"
Awesome people

"This is a great to recover strength and endurance of life.  I am still in PT and thanks to Jonathan, Matt, Ashley and Sarah for working so patience with me since May 2021 to present.  You all are the BEST!"
"Matt and his staff worked diligently to ensure that my therapy goals were met. The atmosphere is fun and laid back, while maintaining the utmost professionalism. I was very impressed with their attention to detail in exercise routines and conditioning. I recommend them highly!"
Nice people and very helpful. They fixed my knee!
"Very knowledgeable, caring staff! I highly recommend using Benchmark for any physical therapy needs you may have. Appointments are readily available and run efficiently!"
"I just wanna say thx for both times you guys help put this humdy dumpy back together again. I wanna start by saying these at BMPT are superb, from the moment you walk into the door getting to meet Ashley taken your temp. Getting info and signing in will definitely warm your welcome if nothing else does. But I must these people are definitely true professionals and I tip my hat to each they are down to earth and have a great sense of humor. During this time of year I wanna say Happy Holidays BMPT and may God speed to each of you and your families. Thx again."



Glenda is very knowledgeable in her field. she helped me a lot with my injury and i felt progress after every session
Nicole did a great job with me - I am motivated to continue it forward.  She was very professional and I feel much better.
"Uchenna Nwafili is AWESOME! I've been to other Physical Therapy offices before but she is the first one that I've truly liked! She is very ""hands on"" and takes her time to assure she is addressing all of my issues! HIGHLY RECOMMEND her to anyone needing PT! You will NOT be disappointed!"
Excellent place for rehabilitation. Judith my physical therapist has her Masters in Physical Therapy. She was able to customize a plan for me that was effective and easy. My insurance was handled in a manner that caused me no concern. Everyone was always sweet and professional. My doctor was pleased with my progress. Thank you for the experience.
"This is a small facility with one PT. A real plus in my book. You do not feel overwhelmed with patients, multiple PT‚Äôs and equipment. It‚Äôs very relaxed. Judy gives you much one-on-one time and is very personable as is Dawn her admin. Centrally located making it easy to get to."
Judith provided extremely helpful therapy that improved my postop issues. She listened to my concerns and answered questions readily. It was very convenient to schedule appointments and everyone was friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend if you need outpatient physical therapy!
"I am a repeat client, a satisfied customer will return time after time! I have had favorable recovery outcomes, thanks! Won't go anywhere else for such great service."
Judy is very supportive and encouraging. Dawn is so helpful with getting appointments scheduled with my situation.
This is the best PT I've experienced. It's given me hope that I'll actually get better.
I have been going there over 5 years for different parts of my body for therapy and each time I go they treat me with respect and consideration. They are a great rehabilitation service.
Excellent service by a dedicated staff.  Courteous and caring individuals who provide outstanding therapy to their clients.
Judith is a great PT  She cares for her patients and wants them to succeed .
"Don't waste your time going here. They will lie to you about your insurance/co-pay and send you a bill for every penny they want 6 months later. When you try to get clarification as to why you were lied to, they just say to pay them. I will be taking them to court for wrongful deception!"
Great place for physical therapy!





Amy and Kyle were great. I had two health conditions at the same time but they worked in tandem to help me get better. Highly recommend the Buford team!
"Everyone is really sweet and welcoming. I recommend Benchmark for you first time or not first time, for physical therapy!"
I couldn't imagine a business that treated their clients with respect and professionalism more than Benchmark Physical Therapy. I would recommend them to all my friends and relatives. Thanks BenchMark !!!!
"This is the 3rd time for 3 different ailments I have been to BenchMark on Carter Road and have benefited greatly every time. Kyle, Chris and Emily have been wonderful.  They are very professional, friendly and encouraging. Bree Haughawout always greeted me with the best smile and wonderful happy chatter that lifted my spirits and helped me start each PT in a good mood.  Chris was very attentive and carefully adjusted my routine and we saw great improvement over a pretty short time.  I highly recommend PT in general, and especially this facility."
"Kyle, Chris, Emily and the front desk lady (sorry I forgot your name) are awesome. I've been going there for 5 weeks now and have improved a lot from before. I can walk again. They and everyone there are friendly, understanding and knowledgeable. I recommend them 100%. I had my doubts before going, but after 4 weeks I am a firm believer. Thank you Kyle, Chris, Emily and front desk lady."
"I highly recommend this Benchmark for anyone! The whole team there are absolutely amazing and have gone above and beyond to help me in my recovery! They feel like family and I am forever grateful for all their help! Kyle, Emily, Bri, Taylor all of you are awesome and thank you for everything!"
Super facility with excellent therapists willing to go the extra mile for your rehab needs. Highly recommend them. Easy and fast to get an appointment as well!
Really good at what they do
"Kyle is the best!! I had various conditions that required PT on different occasions. I continued to return to this Benchmark location for each condition because Kyle was able to provide the appropriate care that I needed. He is an excellent listener, compassionate, and truly cares for his patients. His ability to pay attention to detail allowed me improve to the point that I was able to return to my activities of daily living sooner than later!! His staff is very professional and just plain nice! I highly recommend this location; especially because Kyle is an excellent Therapist and is supported by a professional staff."
Great experience at Buford Benchmark Physical Therapy. Kyle and his team are very professional and the program helped my injured knee tremendously! This PT is highly recommended to anyone who needs some help after the injury. Michaela
"Everyone here is awesome. The doctor definitely sent me to the right place. Definitely a family-oriented place, they make you feel welcome and very understanding. They make sure that you‚Äôre progressing every step of the way. I love it here. Would easily recommend this place to anyone that is looking for Physical Therapy.

P.S. Kyle always come through with the fire socks and clean bow-tie on Thursday."
"Over the past 3 months I was a DPT student interning at this Benchmark location with Kyle. I had an awesome experience and really fell in love with the clinic. Kyle is very personable and truly wants each and every patient to get better. This attitude is only amplified but the bubbly Alysa, who works at the front desk. My experience here was great and I will really miss working with such a great team."
"Kyle and his team are 1st class.  They all are absolutely awesome. You honestly feel like part of the family. Kyle knows exactly what he is doing and I would recommend anyone needing Physical Therapy to go see Kyle and his team.  I will go back there in the future if I require more physical therapy, hands down they are the best in town."
"After a not so good experience at another PT, I actually look forward to coming to see Kyle and the gang at Benchmark. They are not only competent, but, very caring and compassionate too... which I feel are all important!  It‚Äôs a skill but also gift to be able to help people who are hurting and they do an awesome job!"
"I had shoulder surgery and was sent to this clinic for physical therapy.  This wasn't the clinic closest to my home, but the staff there was AMAZING I had to continue therapy there!  My physical therapist Kyle was the best at the Office! Him and Alysa made my experience so great I would recommend them to anyone needing physical therapy."
"Great staff and wonderful facility! When I first started physical therapy (from a broken ankle) I could hardly walk and had to use a walker. Kyle was my physical therapist and was so helpful and encouraging, physical therapy was instrumental in my recovery!"
"I'm currently a DPT student under the supervision of Kyle for my first clinical experience, and I can honestly say I have learned so much in just the past 4 weeks I've been here. Kyle consistently does a great job pushing me out of my comfort zone as a student and you can see that he does the same with his patients! Kyle and Alysa, the office coordinator, both do a great job daily with having patients feel as if they're at home and that therapy at this clinic shouldn't feel like a chore. I will definitely miss this clinic when I'm done interning here!"
Benchmark Physical Therapy at Lanier Islands Parkway is the BEST!  Kyle and staff are so friendly and helpful!  They actually make going to therapy FUN!! Kyle helped me recover from a tough surgery and I am grateful for that! I highly recommend them above all others!!
I came to this physical therapy for a knee injury and ended up at the same place for my back/neck injury. I have always felt comfortable at this location and would never go to another one. The staff was professional yet made you feel at home. I would not reccomend any other physical therapy location! Alysa also went above and beyond at the front desk making my 5 year old daughter feel comfortable  since I had to bring her with me to my appointments.
Wonderful enthusiastic staff! Fully recommend this location the best physical therapy I‚Äôve ever received! The team here are full of knowledge and are also flexible with scheduling. Love this place! ü§ò
"BenchMark Physical Therapy has been a huge help with my back issues!  They are friendly, knowledgeable, and always had convenient appointment times!  And they are close to home!  Love them!  Highly recommended!"
"I can't say enough about this team, but I'll try to keep it brief. Coming in after my 2nd back surgery, I was less than enthusiastic about starting therapy after years of cycling in and out of other clinics for varying spinal conditions. Kyle and his crew, however, completely changed my tune!
At my first visit with Kyle, I could barely walk more than a few feet at a time without pain. After a few long weeks with lots of sweat and plenty of laughs (especially with Alyssa), I ended up being able to return, full time, to nursing a full MONTH sooner than projected!
My family and coworkers are constantly in awe of what this team has done for me, considering where I started, and I am forever grateful!
I would recommend them to any and everyone who needs therapy for any reason. You won't regret it."
"I highly recommend Benchmark Lanier location. Kyle and staff are knowledgeable, personable, & empathetic to all. I was in physical therapy 3 times a week for about 5 months or so. They provide hands on, one on one treatment. The office and equipment are clean and orderly, and the staff is friendly, professional, and flexible with scheduling. While going through physical therapy, everything from proper strengthening, range of motion and stretching, to monitoring your pain levels during therapy is handled in a professional caring manner. It was a joy to see everyone when I was there. Enjoyed a lot of laughter and smiles.
If you‚Äôre looking for caring, committed professionals, schedule an appointment with Benchmark Lanier Islands Parkway."
Great place highly recommend if needing physical therapy. Not many places do dry needling and this place does. Very knowledgeable therapist and staff. You will not be disappointed.
I'm so thankful for Kyle I have been in some unbearable pain and after one visit I am able to walk and feel better thanks to Alysa so friendly and helpful makes a good cup of coffee I recommend this place if you have no hope of getting better the best
"Kyle and his staff make PT a lot less stressful. No PT is fun but Benchmarks PT has done a wonderful job for both me and my wife. I had my left hip replaced on 2/25/19, my wife had rotator surgery on her right shoulder on 3/21/19, so we are both in PT at the same time. I would highly recommend Benchmark PT for anyone who has the need, Kyle and staff are very friendly and great to work with. Bob and Nina Kenney"
"After having a total of 4 knee surgeries, and 4 different physical therapists over the past 10 years, Kyle is by far the best! His bedside manner, encouragement, and excitement for my progress is what really kept me going!"
"Kyle and the Benchmark team are the best therapists in the area.  The facility is excellent and the PT regimens are spot on.  My family members have all gone to Benchmark and have had great results each time.  The staff is always friendly, caring and courteous."
I had a great experience at BenchMark PT. They walked me through the whole process and let me go at a comfortable pace. I loved my time here and would recommend it to anyone else in need.
"Everyone from receptionist to the PT staff (Kyle & Maymol) do a fantastic job.  I have used two PT services in the past 4 years, but these folks are the best at making you feel welcome."
Such a fun and upbeat environment to be apart of! Everyone definitely made going to PT a much better experience and truly cared about my injury recovery.
"After Rotator Cuff surgery I was not looking forward to PT. However my experience with Kyle and his people at Benchmark has been GREAT. They made something that I had to do , but not wanting to do, enjoyable. Can't say enough about these folks."
"These are the most friendly and professional group of people. If you need help, I would definitely recommend going there and seeing kyle"
Kyle was awesome and worked with me to relieve my back pain.
Kyle does his job with efficiency and is very professional compared to other therapists I have visited. I highly recommend.
Very friendly staff. While out of town they answered my questions and were very helpful in planning therapy for a future date while visiting family
Great office and staff. Always on time . No waiting and very pleasant. So glad my doctors office contacted them first. I may have  travel much further and not had such good care. Thanks Kyle and Alysa.
I love those guys at Benchmark Physical Therapy Lanier Islands Parkway they r awesome at what they do and i am so thankful that my doctor sent me to them.I am giving them 5 star's and i would give them 6 star's if i could i don't know what i would do if i didn't go to them twice a week they have done wonders with my pain.I thank God i found a way to stop my pain without medicine.I will continue to go to them because they r not just awesome at stopping my pain they r so friendly and easy to talk to thank y'all sooo much.

"Brooke, Sam, and the staff at the Jasper location were all incredible! They reduced my pain significantly and gave me tools to use at home to make the results last. Their customer service was top-notch! I will recommend them all the time! They genuinely care about every patient's individual needs!"
"Thank you to the entire staff at the Jasper, Ga clinic. Thinking back the on my physical condition,  nerve damage and pain at the beginning of therapy, it is amazing how much they helped me to regain quality of life in just 3 months.
Found all staff members at this clinic to be professional,  knowledgeable,  compassionate and extremely helpful.  The premises are always clean, comfortable and neat
My personal therapist,  Brooke, (Lauren Brooke King, PT, DPT), was remarkable and impressed me with her knowledge and empathic intuition.  She correctly evaluated and treated my condition. Provided numerous exercises that she taught and provided printed details for home sessions. I began to feel better from the first session. The dry needling was especially effective as it helped reduce pain, tingling and numbness. Thank you Doctor Brooke, you are the best!
If you need physical therapy,  I can highly recommend the Jasper, Ga clinic."
"My first contact with BenchMark. Truely a fantastic location to rehab. Worked out with Kimberly and staff. She designed program to meet my needs and speed my recovery. Great professional, well trained, and knowledgeable team!  Highly recommend!!!"
"Benchmark Physical Therapy is a super experience from beginning to end. Right up front the reception is courteous and user friendly. All of the staff are gracious, positive and professional. I‚Äôve had two knee replacements and been to PT for other issues and this is my favorite location. I left pain-free and totally satisfied. Robert"
"Sam was fantastic, I couldn‚Äôt move my shoulder at all, and three months later I‚Äôm recovered and headed back to work!!! 10/10"
My therapist Brooke King was wonderful. She was so patient with me and helpful during my recovery. All of the staff were very friendly as well.
"For the past two months the staff at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Jasper, Georgia has provided me with care treating me after my knee replacement surgery.  My primary therapist was Brooke, but I was also helped by Kim.  The entire staff provided with assistance.  Throughout the entire process the therapist Brooke and staff created a comprehensive treatment program, explained everything, listened to my concerns, and offered helpful encouragement and advice for home care.

I highly recommend this business and location in Jasper for physical therapy.  It is a great group of people!  I will miss seeing them!
Matt M."
"My experience at the Benchmark PT Jasper location was top notch. My PT Kim was amazing. She is very knowledgeable and able to cater the plan to individual needs and send you home w/ exercise programs that work. Staff is great and all are personable and helpful. When my time was up, I felt like I was leaving my family. Best of all, the issue I was treated for (hip) is doing well and the strengthening program has been successful to also support previous knee problems to avoid surgery. Win Win all the way around. I highly recommend this place and will be sending my husband here for his back :)"
"I was extremely pleased with the professionalism and kindness of all the staff. My therapist Lauren King addressed my goals and gave me a variety of exercises. She was very understanding and personable.
I would highly recommend BenchMark Physical Therapy to anyone needing their services."
"What a terrific staff at BenchMark! Very friendly, proffessional, and clean! Sam was very knowledgeable and had me back to 100% in no time. They truly go above and beyond!!! I cant reccommend BenchMark in Jasper enough! Thank you so much!!!"
"I had two surgeries on my Achilles Tendon and truly thought I would never walk right or be able to go up and down stairs in a normal fashion. The people at Benchmark in Jasper GA
made a believer out of me. They had me doing things I thought were funny. But wow, I am able to walk and go up and down stairs as close to normal as I could have ever hoped. The staff is great, from Molly the assistant. to all the therapist, Kim was my main therapist but they we‚Äôre all great. The receptionist was always friendly glad to help with any scheduling changes I needed. Thanks to one and all."
"My Dr. sent me to BenchmarJasper, to work on prolonging knee surgery .I wanted better mobility. My therapist kim was awesome!!!After a month of strengthening exercises and sending me home with a program, my mobility and gait much improved.The entire staff is wonderful and makes it such a happy place .I will miss seeing them."
Kim and the staff at BenchMark Jasper are a critical part of my recovery from two hip replacements. Kim is very knowledgeable and always helps me make progress. I highly recommend her and Benchmark.
"Benchmark certainly exceeded all my expectations! My PT, Lauren, was amazing. She was extremely professional and took the time to discuss my goals and how we would reach them. All the staff were very friendly. Everyone was wearing masks and if they weren‚Äôt with a patient they were wiping down the equipment. Thank you all"
"When I had my first appt I was going through some awful vertigo, couldn't walk without holding onto something. Brooke was and still is very patient and knowledgeablable and has helped me so much in the 2 weeks I've been going there.   I highly recommend this office, everyone is very friendly"
"I received surgery on a labrum tear in my shoulder,  November 10th, 2020. I started Physical Therapy with Benchmark in Jasper Georgia on the 12th. I just completed my last session with them today March 1st 2021. Choosing Benchmark in Jasper Georgia was a decision I am so grateful I made for myself.  The staff are awesome.  My PhysicalTherapist was amazing.  She got me through some tough times, including a frozen shoulder.  I highly recommend this team of professionals."
"I was referred to Benchmark because of headaches, neck , and shoulder pain from tension and muscle knots in the shoulders.My therapy consisted of exercises to strengthen the muscles along with dry needling. I felt relief after the first dry needling session. Kim (PT) was amazing and I would highly recommend Benchmark for any physical therapy needs. The staff was also professional and friendly."
"Professional staff who worked hard to meet my goals for recovery after an injury. I felt like they cared about my progress. Attentive and caring, from Physical Therapists (Kim was wonderful) to front office staff (Dawn)!  Thank you for helping me heal!"
I came in benchmark with a serious knee injury Brooke King was my therapist she did a great job push me hard to get where I am today she did a great job the staff were very nice also very helpful my experience was great thank you very much
Benchmark Physical Therapy  helped me get my life back . The therapy they did with me  made a huge difference . My therapist took her time with me and really worked on the source of the pain . I am very grateful that they are right here in Jasper .
"Went to this location after a car wreck, Kim was my Pt. She was wonderful!  My back is much better!   Highly recommended."
The best place to go for your therapy!! They will take care of you. More 1 on 1 work and a more personal tailored experience. Bryn and the rest of the staff are amazing and really care about you as a individual. Such a great place!
Brook has been great at helping me in the road to recovery.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  I most definitely recommend!!!!
"First and foremost I would to thank Dr Bryn  and his staff for such friendly, caring and focused attention!

I own an executive search & placement firm and I clearly understand the difficulty of recruiting and retaining skilled, dedicated, and friendly staff. This office in particular has accomplished an amazing feat in that the entire office is comprised of such skilled, friendly and caring individuals!

The work was difficult as expected however the entire experience and my functional results were well above expectation and for that I am grateful!

Cheers indeed!"
"I had a wonderful experience with BenchMark PT, Jasper!  I had pulled my hip flexor about four years ago, had some needling treatment at another location, but just never fully recovered.  Within a few weeks of treatment with Bryn and Eric, I am pain-free!  Bryn is very skilled with the process of dry needling, and hitting the trigger points. Eric was very patient with me during the exercise drills.  The staff here is very professional and a joy to work with.  Thanks Benchmark!"
"The therapy really helped my foot, and I am able to walk without pain. Bryn was really personable and a good therapist. The entire staff was very friendly, and I will come back if needed."
Bryn and all the staff are great and fun to be around. They all ask how you feel during your exercises. I give this experience an A+. Thank you for being here and confident with your jobs.
Great experience for my first time doing  Physical therapy. Bryn was very kind and helpful. He let me set my own pace once I got into it and now I am flying along to my ultimate goal of getting back to myself. Thanks to Bryn and all the staff there for everything. üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
I just finished 8 sessions with the GREAT folks at Jasper BenchMark PT. Bryn was my primary PT but was also helped by others on the staff. Receptionist Dawn was GREAT too! Bryn worked with me to help alleviate the extreme pain in my right shoulder. Doctor Flint gave me a steriod shot & then recommended going to a PT for a month. I am very happy I chose BenchMark. All the staff were excellent in their caring & professionalism. I feel like a new man now...and at 75 that is a major accomplishment. HONESTLY! ABE
"Can not express how incredible my experience with Benchmark was. I had a major injury the week my wife and I came home with our baby, and I was feeling the stress and worry of our situation, then I started with Benchmark. From the very beginning they treated me like I was family, took excellent care of me, and I left feeling confident. I looked forward to my appointments because it wasn't just physical therapy, it was like hanging out with friends. Everyone here is not just friendly, but very knowledgeable as well. Every goal that we set I met and exceeded. I credit my full recovery to the amazing people at Benchmark and would recommend them to anyone and everyone."
BenchMark Physical Therapy was very clean and organized. They are also very nice and understanding. After my physical therapy my back pain started to decrease and go away.
"I  had traumatic rotator cuff tears.  When I first began therapy I thought that it would never be easy and that I would always be ""damaged"".  However, the BenchMark people didn't feel that way.  They were encouraging, kind, and very knowledgeable.  Kim was the primary therapist for me.  She never got impatient, frustrated, or discouraged.  She kept working my shoulder and I have to say that I've come a very long way.  Not only Kim, but the entire Jasper BenchMark team was part of my therapy.  If one of them saw me doing an exercise wrong, they would gently correct me.  They become a family to me.  I will never be able to thank them enough for giving my arm back to me.  Thank you all."
"The staff at BenchMark Physical Therapy of Jasper, GA is excellent. They are very accommodating with appointments and special needs. All of the staff,
from Dawn (office mgr), PT techs Heather and Eric, and Physical Therapists Bryn and Kim truly listened to how I was feeling (physically and emotionally) regarding my orthopedic troubles.  Bryn, my primary Physical Therapist and Kim (filled in for Bryn 1 day) were very careful with the therapies and my limitations and fears of painful movements etc.  Of course any PT will likely be uncomfortable at times, they always ensured they were careful with what caused me a good bit of pain and tried to be as gentle as possible.  They developed a plan so that I was doing what I needed to in order to make safe progress as much as possible but to not over do it and lead to setbacks.  They are encouraging, kind, and truly care about their patients and their wellbeing.  They listen intently and are honest with expectations, limitations etc.  I trust them wholeheartedly and would recommend them to anyone needing PT that doesn‚Äôt take want to be treated like just another patient.  They talk to you and try to get the job done while making you feel comfortable, welcome, and at ease."
"I was referred to Benchmark for a shoulder issue and this was my first experience with PT.  Frankly I was skeptical. As soon as I arrived for my first appointment, I quickly saw how warm and friendly everyone was.  I worked mostly with Bryn and he was the perfect combination of friendly and highly skilled.  After 8 sessions, I cannot believe how much my shoulder has improved.  I'm a convert!  You have my highest recommendation."
The people there are amazing! They are the sweetest and make you feel like family. I would definitely recommend going BenchMark if you want to make a speedy recovery!
"The staff (Bryn, Kim, Heather, Eric and Dawn) are FABULOUS!!!  I strongly recommend them if you are in need of physical therapy. They are very dedicated to getting you back to
where you were before your accident.   I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually enjoyed going to therapy because of their attitudes.  I'm kind of sad that I have ""graduated"" and now on my own.  I just can't say enough good things about the staff at this location."
"I was having severe right hip and leg pain and my Physicain suggested I try Physical Therapy to improve this situation. I also needed a cane to assist walking. I elected to go to Benchmark Physical Therapy, Jasper, GA. Bryn, my Physical Therapist, chose a series of exercises along with dry needling to improve my situation. After 9 weeks, I am pleased that my pain level was reduced to a much lower and managable level. However, I still a cane to assist walking. I am very pleased with the attention and care given by Bryn and assistants. Dawn, the receptionist, was very helpful and accommodating setting up the schedule for my visits. I would recommend Benchmark Physical Therapy in Jasper to anyone who needs this type of service."
The staff and therapist are professional and very helpful. I would  recommend Bench Mark to anyone needing physical theraphy. Most of  my goals were met and they accommodated  for my specific needs to make sure I was comfortable and got the most from my therapy.
Benchmark is the best physical therapy facility in Pickens County. I'm so thankful to all of the staff and especially the therapist Bren and Kim! They got me back to my old self after my knee surgery and without all the pain that other places put you through. Benchmarks the best!
Great experience. I felt comfortable with the entire staff and enjoyed my appointments. Would recommend to anyone.
"The physical therapists at this office are caring, competent, and demonstrate great interpersonal skills. They helped enable my shoulder problems to heal allowing me to perform activities that were restricted before."
The staff is wonderful!!
The staff in Jasper are all incredible.  Unfortunately I had to use them twice for different issues. Both times I was treated like family. I have never been to a facility where everyone is so friendly and professional.  Thank you soooo much!!!!!
Amazing staff and amazing results!
BenchMark is an excellent place to begin your journey of healing. They LISTEN and their programs are designed around your needs regardless of your injury.
"I was very pleased with the therapy I received at the Jasper BenchMark with Bryn. All those who work there were also helpful and friendly.

Linda Stepp"
"I would highly recommend Benchmart to anyone! Everyone that works at the jasper location who has helped me through a rough time with a hip replacement from an accident I had at work has been more than caring!! and most of all they have heart!! I would like to thank (Sam,Kim,Brett) the therapists, (Dawn) the receptionist, (Heather andJames )the assistance .these people do amazing work ,not just on me,but all their patients who walk thru their doors.they make you feel so welcome,that you forget about your pain for awhile and gets you on the right track to recovery or close to where you need to be.so again THANK YOU ALL and I love you all.."
The team is great. Kim Johnson is the best!
I could not have ask for a better place and staff to do my physical therapy!




"Very welcoming and friendly staff! Easy to follow directions. Therapy was challenging, but not impossible to complete. Would highly recommend."
"Each therapist that I worked with was very professional, patient and encouraging. The exercises they assigned to me really helped me gain strength in my knee after having surgery for a torn meniscus. My pain level went from a 8-9 to around a 2-3.  The receptionists are extremely pleasant to the clients as they enter and exit. Thank you Benchmark Team!"
"David, my physical therapist has helped me so much! It feels like I've made so much improvement in the 10 visits I've done so far. I wasn't thrilled about coming to physical therapy but he has worked so well on me that I'm needing less injections at my orthopedics!! He listens well to what my concerns are and works on me accordingly. I've also worked with a couple of the other physical therapists and they're ALL GREAT!!! Great set of staff and most definitely recommend going to benchmark if you're needing physical therapy!!"
"I was referred to BenchMark for PT after a car accident. I had waited several months to hear from another agency without success. BenchMark got me in  for an appointment quickly. The PT team especially Neehtma was very professional, kind and attentive. They offer genuine care in a society that lacks concern for others. I would definitely recommend their services."
"Tell Grace she is not allowed to leave!! Seriously, I was never much of a believer in PT but this place and Grace and Neema in particular have changed my mind! Also the folks at the desk are rockstars as well! ;)"
"Excellent physical therapy practice! All of the therapists were good, the atmosphere was relaxing and fun. My pain was excruciating and they were able to resolve it for me. Their motto should be ""limp in, leap out"". Jessica runs a great facility. Sharon is amazing, I had accidentally gone to the clinic next door for my first appointment,  she not only found me and got me to the right place, she got them to refund my money on the spot!"
Very professional and thorough. Would recommend Nema and the other staff highly. Pleasant atmosphere and sincerely interested in patient welfare.
"I was sent to Benchmark Physical Therapy by my orthopedic surgeon to work on my right knee after surgery. I came one afternoon to check out the facility and I was glad I did. The front desk staff was very pleasant.  I picked Dr. Jessica as my main therapist to work with. She was very professional, knowledgeable, courteous, friendly and easy to work with. She explained the exercises in detail i.e. what I needed to do, how it should be done and which muscles the exercise was targeted to work on. My therapy was done three times a week, for period of eight weeks. Dr. Jessica printed the exercises for me to work at home so I can continue my exercises on the days I was not at the facility."
This is my 3rd time using BenchMark and each time I am been very pleased with the out come.  Neema was excellent and was able to pin point the issue and work on correcting it.  I would highly recommend Neema and BenchMark to anyone that needs PT.
This place has definitely exceeded my expectations! After breaking my foot I was super timid to push myself....I was feeling down because it was taking longer than I wanted it to to feel better. My first day coming here I was super nervous because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to do what they were asking me to do....I found that the therapist does not push but encourages. she is super gentle when manipulating or massaging my foot and I never have any pain during therapy. All the time after therapy the next day my foot feels so much better.....she's able to tell me the things that she's doing and why she's doing them and how when I work on activities at home how that will help strengthen my foot.....I was still having a little bit of pain in the ankle area... She really listen to my concern and worked on it. I was so amazed that today I woke up and the pain that I was having while walking has been cut down at least by 70%! I really feel like they care about you and they want you to do your very best. I have gained so much confidence by going here! My recovery still continues but I felt compelled to write this because I am so pleased with the progress
"The therapists are wonderful. I have been there for Lymphedema, shoulder therapy and hip therapy over the past 5 years."
Keri is wonderful! Thank you for your help!
"Terrible, appointment time is 11:00 always arrive early and still getting called back late around 11:10 or 11:15.I never get the full hour of therapy..they are so rude by talking about past patients and eating up time when their suppose to be concerned and helping u with physical therapy.the little things they do you can do on your own, just goggle it just like they do..sorry is and under statement.a complete waste of gas and time.if I had to recommend a therapy facility it would be a gym are in your own home..my name is j.dixson 4/14/2016 no longer a current patient after today.."
"Good, kind therapists."


"As a clinic they deserve five stars.  It is new, easily accessible, clean, and well equipped. It is amazingly easy to communicate and bond with all the current staff. They are excellent diagnostic and therapeutic clinicians. Current staffing limits availability of appointments. When they address that element then we can talk again about five stars."
"I have been attending this physical therapy location for a few months now as I am in the process of healing from a shoulder injury and surgery, and I am so incredibly thankful for Jerry and Jonathan. From day 1, Jerry has been so kind and patient with me as I navigated this stressful process. He educated and guided me as I considered my options and referred me to the best doctors in town for the injury that I had. He is extremely knowledgeable and answered any question that I had. He truly cares about and wants the best for each of his clients and their journeys to recovery and a healthy and pain free life. Jonathan is so welcoming and kind and immediately eases me as I walk into the clinic, just by saying hi! He makes scheduling appointments a breeze and is extremely organized. I am so grateful for the team at PT Solutions Buckhead and highly recommend them!"
"I started going to PT Solutions of Buckhead about 2 months ago and am SO grateful I did. I was nervous at first because I didn‚Äôt think PT would be effective but I was definitely proved wrong here.  From my first evaluation appointment to every other follow up, Jerry always has an answer to my (million) questions, he clearly explains why I feel pain in the parts of my foot that I do, he‚Äôs extremely knowledgeable, well informed and knows exactly what the right steps to recovery are. He makes sure not to rush the process, which may be very tempting for me, but I listen to him because I know he‚Äôs right and this has been the most important reason why I have been able to recover so well.
Every week, I feel better and better and I‚Äôm almost back to no pain in my foot, so I‚Äôm very excited about the progress I‚Äôve made and how caring and supportive all the staff have been - especially Jonathan who is so friendly every time I walk in and makes me feel very safe because he always checks my temperature and makes the whole experience a very warm and friendly environment. Highly recommend!"
"Landed here by accident and that was the best possible rehab accident ever. Showed up with excruciating shoulder pain and limited range of motion. Six weeks later and I‚Äôm breaking a sweat and moving pain-free. Jerry, my PT, is passionate about what he does and it‚Äôs that passion that got me moving again. Jonathan at the front desk makes sure everyone coming/going is healthy (temperature checks, masks, etc). The facility is clean, modern and Covid-safe. Thanks to Jerry and PT Solutions Buckhead, I have a new lease on life after being sidelined for almost two years."
"After my knee replacement, the folks at PT Solutions of Buckhead got me on my feet and feeling stronger right away. The combination of education, customized exercises and positive energy that Gerry and Jeff brought to every session made all the difference. Jonathan's pleasant greeting - and professional follow-through with the insurance company - was a blessing. I highly recommend PT Solutions!"
"This place is AWESOME!! I had a total knee replacement and was in so much pain & in a very delicate space when I started going here... There‚Äôs always an upbeat playlist going... Johnathan is always a welcoming face when you enter, as he takes your temperature... And I‚Äôve been working with Jerry, who is wonderful to work with! He‚Äôs encouraging & tailors a therapy regimen specifically for you & adjusts according to your progress... (or regress). I‚Äôm happy with my progress & I highly recommend PT Solutions of Buckhead for physical therapy!"
It‚Äôs the best physical therapy I‚Äôve ever gotten. The facility is very nice and clean and they always wipe down all the equipment after it‚Äôs been used. Jerry is super nice and chill and always knows how to fix me. Jonathan is the best and never misses a beat when scheduling appointments. Great location and great service. Hands down my first and best recommendation for physical therapy of any kind. Also they play music so it‚Äôs not awkward.
Well I used to love this physical therapy place. I had a fantastic therapist. She is no longer there. But I had a new therapist and we got off on the wrong foot. And that is why I gave this rating. I will be trying another office because as a whole PT Solution is a great place for therapy.
"This place is amazing! Everyone truly listens to your goals and what you expect to get our of physical therapy. Jonathan has always been a great help at the front, always greeting me with a warm smile. Doctors Jerry and Caitlyn have been really helpful when it came to lessening my back pain and furthering my mobility once I was injured. I am currently still going, progressing each week with their aid and support. I could not think of a better place to do physical therapy than at PT Solutions."
Great facility. Very productive and effective. Kris is knowledgeable and tries to help in every way. Very enjoyable experience.
"This place was relatively new when I decided to try it. I was going to have a hip replacement and a year ago had back service. I came in before my surgery and met the person that would be working with me. I signed up that day and made my appointment. Due to a set back I was not able to come in as planned but they were
Understanding and rescheduled. I like the way they can work with you even though you are not assigned to them. The young lady as you come the receptionist is very personable. Always smiling and helpful. You are encouraged to voice your concerns and they address those concerns. I am very pleased."
Was an overall great experience. Beat expectations on recovery
"The crew at PT Solutions, Copperhill is great.
They‚Äôve worked with me after three surgeries and put me well on road to recovery each time.  The professionalism, expertise and kindness of Kathy, Patti and Heather will be remembered always."
Heather The PT is wonderful makes you feel very comfortable. Very caring. This center is very clean. Easy to get around in.  Erica is always smiling helping out and makes you feel Good. If you need PT this is the place to go!
I love my experience with PT solutions. They are caring and attentive to my needs. They are all passionate about what they do!
"They are amazing, they treat you like family. Israel and Noah are the best therapist by far that I know. Ms Victoria is really nice. I love them all."
"I was seen by the therapists of PTSolutions recently.  I was diagnosed by and worked with each of these
Thoroughly professional individuals.  They were pleasant, knowledgeable, and sensitive to my needs.  I advise anyone who needs assistance to check them out in Hillsville, Virginia."
"This was my first experience with any physical therapy.  Relief from my neck pain started with my first visit and continued to improve with each follow up.  The staff are all professional, knowledgeable, and friendly.  I would recommend PT Solutions to anyone."
"Heather and her team are absolutely the best...
Punctual,attentive, respectful and knowledgeable. The facility is pristine, orderly and well run .The best by far."
Jonathan was great!
All the staff's there is very nice and helpful and fun to be around and I will continue to go back there.
Chris and Christine are awesome!  Your comfort and health are their first priority.  The location is a mile from my house.
"Very clean, inviting atmosphere! Enjoyed my therapy session last week! Headed back today!"
"Delighted to have found this wonderful facility with its excellent staff. Caring, competent and well educated staff, makes this truly, THE HEALING PLACE!"
"Knowledgeable, caring and makes me feel better."
"After 3 sessions with Katie I saw more improvement than I have in anything else I've tried the last 5 years.If I'd known PT was capable of this level of impact on pain and mobility, I'd have done this 4+ years ago."
Great staff knowledgeable friendly and very efficient
"Staff are friendly, well trained, willing to help, listen, mostly move problems to solutions. I look forward to working with them each time I go."
Fabulous caring and knowledgeable staff!







They're helping me regain use of my damaged parts and pieces. They're kind and gentle yet firm. A real a Godsend!
Great people and nice people

"I recommend highly PT Solutions in Chatsworth, Ga.  The staff is caring, friendly, informative and excellent at what they do.  I thought when you got ‚Äúold‚Äù you just had aches and pains - live with it.  Not so.  It is amazing how good I feel now and what I can do again.  They are the best!"
"I had suffered with shoulder pain for years. The great staff at PT solutions knew exactly what I needed to help with the pain. Dr. Phil Moore was very kind and considerate, being careful not to overwork me, which I really appreciated. I would highly recommend these folks for any needs you might have!"
"Excellent group of professionals. Phil, Saul, Elisabeth and Richard are all phenomenal. When I first started physical therapy I struggled with everyday tasks due to painful shoulder and neck pain. Upon completion of therapy I'm a new man. Also I am visually impaired and all the staff were more then accommodating and willing to lend a hand. Again excellent place filled with knowledgeable, and kind staff."
"This was my second time going to PT Solutions for therapy after total knee replacements. This group is awesome, they determine what you need to work on and help you accomplish your goals. Fiona (my right bionic knee) has proven she is strong and capable of helping me live a more active lifestyle even if I am 70 years young.
Big thank you to Jeff, Richard and Tanner for knowing what I needed and helping me achieve my goals.
The staff is friendly, professional and courteous.
If you need any type of therapy check this team out. You won't be disappointed."
"PT Solutions is a great place to get the help you need when you are trying to regain your moblility and quality of life.  The professionalism and care of the staff from the Physical Therapists, PT Assistants and Clerical Staff is top notch.  Learning how to use your knees again after bilateral knee replacement is a slow and hard process, but with the right help you learn how to regain their use and are encouraged to get back to a productive, pain-free life.  The convenience to our home has made this the Right Choice for me and I would encourage others in the Chatsworth Area to take advantage of PT Solutions!!!"
This place and these people are incredible. They amount of time and effort they put in to make sure you are taken care of from beginning to end is exceptional. I would recommend anyone looking for physical or speech therapy services to their location!
The people at PT Solutions are great. They have helped me greatly. I am back on my feet. I will be recomending them. to all of my friends. I'm having my left hip replaced in 3 months and am not using home health. I'm going straight to PT Solutions for physical therapy.
The BEST physical therapy office! The entire staff is so kind and therapists are compassionate and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend going to PT Solutions of Chatsworth.
P.T.  SOLUTIONS is the best place to come for physical therapy I have ever been to. They are very caring and they stay with you and show you personal attention as you are doing the exercises. They are always asking if you are ok or do you need anything.  If anyone ever needs physical therapy I highly recommend  that you come to PT SOLUTIONS in Chatsworth Ga. I love it here and I love the people and I'm sure you will feel the same.
"I had surgery for a complete labrum tear. I‚Äôve been to another therapy clinic before coming to PT Solutions and it was night and day. Lisa Spiker is definitely a game changer. I went from negative internal rotation, to surprising my doctors just after a month working with her. While also rehabbing with PT Solutions they fixed my frozen shoulder syndrome. With that being said I am now cleared for all sports activities and have full range of motion. I highly recommended PT Solutions for anyone seeking physical therapy help."
The speech therapist that worked with my grandson was wonderful. She had the best attitude and tried so many things with him.







"This place is first rate.  I needed a place to go while out of town for a month in order to continue my perpetual physical therapy routine and regain strength in my injured shoulder.   I was surprised at how much my therapist Hannah knew about my rare underlying condition which complicates my therapy.  When I was through with my sessions, I felt much stronger.  Everyone who helped me had the same kind professional demeanor and were good listeners.  Highly recommend."
Very knowledgeable and friendly. Kayla is very smart and encouraging and at the same time challenges me to make the most of the hour session and teaches me how to help myself at home.
Everyone at Benchmark Physical Therapy learns your name and greets you like an old friend.  The physical therapy is excellent and always done at an individual's own pace.  Teresa Dawson communicates throughout the session and lets one know what progress is being made and what to do at home.  I met several others who felt as I did...completely satisfied with the results!
"Great team. They listened to.my concerns and provided a plan to help "" work"" my mobility such that I can pickup my 2 year old daughter as well as do work around house without pain. Bless them!!!"
"I‚Äôm now in round two of physical therapy inside of a year, and as sad as that makes me I‚Äôm glad I found BenchMark.  The therapists I‚Äôve worked with really know what they‚Äôre doing and have provided great relief through the physical therapy and the home exercises.  Some other bonuses about this place:
1. Great location
2. Easy scheduling at the times I need
3. They accept my insurance
4. Plenty of parking
5. Great people working in the office - really great vibe"
Due to the pandemic I attempted to do virtual sessions through Telehealth. It was different but I was able to finish my program. I am in better shape and would recommend  Benchmark to others.
The staff is so welcoming and friendly. They are very attentive to what is ailing you and work on teaching you the best ways to heal. I look forward to making a full recovery and getting back to all my normal activities.
Came here with a very bad upper trapezius injury and left with it completely in shape! Kudos to the professional and caring staff: they made sure I was OK every step of the way. They helped me so much! Thank you to all the doctors and staff who are apart of this lovely physical therapy practice: y‚Äôall are awesome!
"DO NOT GO HERE! I REPEAT DO NOT GO HERE!!
Mae will have 3-4 patients at a time and have you waiting. In the meantime, she wants you to sit and workout on a bike, which I can do at home gym. However, on your medical report, they will falsely document that you come in late, leave early, and didn't complete therapy. I strongly recommend to use another source for therapy and do not come here."
They are the best! After my accident I needed some therapy and I am glad I chose them to help me. I am a lot better now after my treatment but I will miss them because it started to feel like family.
"I am no stranger to Physical Therapy as over the years I have been to 8 different ones. I am writing to recommend Benchmark Dunwoody! A little less than 3 months ago I had surgery on a torn biceps tendon. I dreaded this surgery as the same shoulder had been operated on 35+ years ago. In the previous surgery I had a screw implanted to stabilize the joint and have experienced limited range of motion ever since. Going in to my recent surgery I was told my rehab could take up to 6 months. 2 weeks after surgery I began visiting Benchmark 3 times per week. I have primarily worked with Mae Mercado, but have also had the pleasure of working with Kathrina Gonzalez, James Connelly, Hannah Goesch, Kirsten and support staff Constance, Katharina, Alex and Chelsey. Everyone of the staff treats their patients like family. I found myself looking forward to seeing before every visit.
As far the progress I am so happy to report I have achieved full range of motion ( that's tremendously better than its been in 40 years). Amazingly at a little less than 3 months I am considered 100%, This was a total team effort, a great surgeon (DR, Duralde) and the wonderful people of Benchmark Physical Therapy!"


"Emory Physical Therapy is Atlanta's newest and most advanced sports PT facility that is located at the Emory Sports Medicine Complex along with the Peak Performance Project, Emory Healthcare Courts and the Atlanta Hawks Basketball Club. Get back in the game flying higher and farther than you could ever imagine by tapping the state of the art technology and professional talent necessary to get you there."
Horrible experience here.  I have done a lot of PT over the years with broken bones - by far the worst healthcare I've received.  Therapist would spend 10-15 minutes with me the rest of the hour I was using old equipment on my own for exorbitant fees - like be careful as they will dig deeply into your wallet for very little actual care.  BTW - 10 sessions did nothing for my condition so spend was large and also useless.
"I wanted someone to know about my experience with Emory Sports Physical Therapy Center.  I had been going to the center for the past six months.  Each time I visited they said ‚Äúthat will be $125 for today.‚Äù  I happily paid and thought my bill was settled.  So after six months of weekly visits, I stopped going and suddenly receive a bill for $726!  And that is billed as just the last four visits!  I‚Äôm afraid they might send me a bill for the other five months if I just pay it.  That‚Äôs another $3,625!  I feel they misrepresented the total due for my visits each week and waited until I stopped going to send me the actual amounts I was accruing each week.  I would not have gone for so long if I knew each visit was ~$300.  That's why they misrepresent the price.  The $125 they said is ""what we are applying to your deductible."""
Great therapists and I'd give this 5 stars if it wasn't for the extremely lackluster scheduling and front desk experience. They need to modernize and allow for patients to check their appointments bookings online AND: reminder calls or texts a few ways before! They do not do this or call to confirm appointments.
"The PTs were just fine. No complaints there. But the admin/billing was rediculous and not worth getting involved in. There were extra charges all over the place for evaluations, etc. Ended up being 2x more than they initially quoted. They were rude and unrelenting, when I called to ask why I was still getting new bills months after ceasing therapy (turns out they had undercharged me earlier!)."
Physical therapists are good. Real pain to get an appointment though. Front desk staff is less than professional.
Had lots of therapy here. Staff are awsome
"Was seen for less than 30 minutes because ""they didn't have time"" for a full session."
Everyone is super nice.




"Great staff, and treatment. They do wonderful work"

I feel very comfortable at this place.  Clean place with good therapists!
"I have never had physical therapy before so I did not know what to expect. I was made to feel at ease from the beginning with assistance making the appointments to beginning and continuing my therapy. My therapist, Jannelle Morgan, was wonderful! She worked diligently to help me strenghten the muscles I needed to correct a problem with my knee. Jannelle listened to my concerns and modified exercises to work better with my physical abilities but still keeping the goal in mind.

I would highly recommend working with Jannelle at PT Solutions at Woodlawn to anyone needing physical therapy"
"Best therapist location in town. I have seen a handful of  therapist throughout  my life for my knees and this location has the most knowledgeable, caring, committed therapist I have ever worked with. Justine was my therapist and is truly the wonderful - she has been my everything toward a successful recovery, but really they all are Carly, Winslow, and Jeniel you can‚Äôt go wrong. Top notch. I would highly recommend this location for PT to anyone. The PT room is open, large, and has all the right equipment you need. Check them out - you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"I met my PT, Winslow Jones, back in December, after a miniscus repair. She got me back quickly so I could be ready in March for my knee replacement.¬† She has not failed to provide outstanding therapy for me once again,¬† gently¬† encouraging me to a point of progress with each visit.¬†¬†My doctor is extremely happy with my progress which I owe, in large part, to Winslow.
Winslow makes PT¬†an  enjoyable experience. She has a friendly personality, while instilling confidence with her excellent knowledge of her craft.¬† PT SOLUTIONS is lucky to have such a professional!"
"I have received care at PT Solutions Woodland for varying issues. Justine and Janelle have consistently shown care, concern, and expertise as physical therapists. With my work schedule, I am also very appreciative of their flexibility in scheduling appointments. Thank you!"
Justine was a great therapist.  She was very professional.  My mom and I both had therapy with her twice a week.  Would highly recommend her.
"I‚Äôve been coming to PT Solutions for almost 2 months now and Winslow has been amazing, very professional, and has helped strengthen the muscles around my knee. Highly recommend!"
"I have an autoimmune disorder and during Covvid Quarantine I've been walking a lot and had a really bad case of Tendonitis and with having inflammation issues and being immune compromised it's an added stress. PT Solutions is awesome, they are very sanitary and professional, everyone has a mask. And before the PT I was having a slow healing process. Justine has been challenging my balance and working my muscles back to better than before!

Thanks PT Solutions!"
Janelle is awesome !
"My beautiful daughter was recently diagnosed with early onset Alzimers.  In addition she was diagnosed with other things which requires some P T. So grateful we picked this Emory Outpatient Ctr. Everyone was so caring. Our P T
Johnelle was absolutely amazing."
Hello everyone just wanted to share this by heart have been suffer with back pain have many therapy sessions with chiropractor not work then one of my friend suggested me for physical therapy n research about I found this place I had just few therapy done I‚Äôm filling better but one thing that because of {DR. GRACIE TEBBANO} this turns possible I never meet that positive n kind person ever I‚Äôm glad that she meets me in such deficits face of my life Thank to GOD ‚ù§Ô∏è
People are friendly and makes you feel like you are at home. My PT is awesome! She explains and help you each step by step. I feel my conditions are definitely improving after following her recommend stretch and exercise. :)
"I am loving my experience at this rehab center! The people are very knowledgeable, friendly, caring and patient (no pun intended). I didn't realize there was so many exercises I could do at home for the problem in my neck. They supplement the things they do at the center as in showing me the correct way to do them, the machines and tools that help, plus massage (my personal favorite)! Thanks guys for being so thorough!"
"Hidden gem! Want a rehab spot that feels like home? Art and his team make a beautiful little family unit. There is warmth, compassion, unbelievable knowledge, and techniques I‚Äôve never before seen, even after 20+ years on and off the PT wagon. Even another patient greeted me and shared how much she loves Art and this center. Be open-minded. Really listen. You will learn so much about the way your body works!

Oh, and ignore the one star below from the shooter. Deductibles are deductibles! We all have them."
"I have been going here for several weeks for an issue with my knee.  The staff are great, esp. Art Peddle.  He knows a lot about physical therapy and how to use it to improve your situation.  His bed-side manner is excellent. He knows just how much to push you to get it to do the most good.  He know which exercises will give you the most benefit and what sequence you should do them in."
"If you want professional treatment, go here . Art and the group are great!
.Thanks
Joe Cashin"
"I'm having a great experience with Art and his staff.  They are skilled, convenient, and pleasant. My rehab from knee surgery is coming along well and ahead of schedule. I wholeheartedly recommend Art and his team."
I like Emily because she take her time to listen and to explain every question I have!
"2nd time for PT @ Emory and was so glad to know Arthur is still there. He is awesome. Talk about knowing his stuff, and going the extra mile. Everyone there is wonderful!"
"Art and staff are awesome.  Besides being knowledgeable, they do a great job of managing expectations as you start the process of recovery.  I highly recommend!"
"Highly professional individuals,  very loving and caring. Thanks to you all for helping me in my injury recovery process."
Staff is extremely professional and caring.  I was referred to this center by an out of state doctor and could not be more pleased with his choice.
Staff and atmosphere is friendly and comfortable.















"Best PT experience I've ever had. Ben gives you personal attention and you know he cares. There are no TVs, which I appreciate. The facility is clean and well maintained. I never once worried about a thing. Being able to access my plan online is just an added bonus. I will definitely recommend and use again if ever necessary."
I have total confidence with the physical therapy that I received from Ben (I have made remarkable recovery)as he is a very competent physical therapist. He is very attentive to his patients and deserves an A+ rating. Not too many other physical therapist deserve such a high rating. Thanks Ben.
"Absolutely the best Physical Therapy place around!  The office is very clean upbeat and friendly.  Ben and Ryan are great Physical Therapist. They are very knowledgeable,  they are there for you to get the most out of your therapy sessions, they listen to your concerns. Tammy is awesome!! very knowledgeable and friendly."
Ben and his staff are best when it comes to helping people improve whatever condition you may come to him with. They actually care about the wellbeing of the people they care for .  They are willing to go above and beyond the normal way rehab is done I have used them twice and both times came away better for using them . So in closing I would recommend them very highly for any rehab needs you may have. I will use the Benchmark Team for any and all rehab needs .
"When I pinched a nerve in my neck, I was in agony. Ben and his team treated me with tender and knowledgeable care. I left each visit feeling so much better, with easy to follow and effective home care/exercise routine to expedite my recovery. I have recommended Benchmark PT to my friends and coworkers! Excellent, top notch care!!"
"BenchMark in Port Wentworth was most helpful in assisting me reach my goals during my recent physical therapy. Ben & Jen were professional, competent & friendly. I highly recommend Ben & his staff if you're looking for a PT clinic in this area."
"I have had physical therapy in the past but, my experience with Ben was, by far, the best experience. He is a very thorough and caring practitioner. I would highly recommend him and his staff for your therapy needs."
My coworker referred me to Benchmark and I wish I listened to her sooner ! Ben helped me more than ortho and chiropractor did in 5 years. I went to Ben with protrusion in L3/L4 and Jennifer and Ben completely healed my injury in few weeks. Prior to that I could not walk for 3 months !!!! Ben is very knowledgeable and genuinely cares! Everyone in the office is super pleasant and if I ever get injured again that‚Äôs where I am going back to  ! Benchmark Port Wentworth made a huge difference in my life !
"I‚Äôve been going to PT at Benchmark for over a year. I have seen many different physical therapists over the years that I have been chronically ill and I have a very complex case, and the physical therapists at Benchmark are the first ones that have cared about helping my whole body function properly, not just the one body part. I‚Äôm so thankful for the physical therapists at Benchmark. I‚Äôm proud of the progress they‚Äôve helped me make already and looking forward to the progress I will make as I get stronger."
"I love going to therapy here. Ben is the therapist and really explains what he is doing and why. Mark is an intern and learning and doing a great job. He is going to be very successful when he is done with school. Rae is the receptionist, but she is more than that. She keeps the music going, and she keeps you on track with your appointments. She also did all the leg work with my insurance. Everyone here remembers you and your stories and makes you feel like family. This is a great place to go and I would recommend everyone here."
"I just love this place. They work hard on making sure you get all the treatments you need during your rehabilitation time. They‚Äôre very fixable, understanding and caring. I highly recommend Benchmark in Porto Wentworth GA"
"I would highly recommend BenchMark Physical Therapy. The staff is extremely helpful and kind.
Ben is an amazing Therapist."
Amazing staff! Very attentive to your needs! Eager to listen and willing to create a custom routine for you. Not a blanket routine that we need to fit.
"I recently started seeing Ben for chronic myofascial neck pain and really bad headaches at least four times a week.  Ben is very knowledgeable and helpful.  His treatment for me has been specific exercises, muscle stretches, along with dry needling my trigger points.  I am seeing great improvement with far less headaches.  I'm very optimistic about my  treatment and looking forward to living day to day with less pain.  Very friendly office too."
"If you want quality physical therapy by someone who knows there stuff, BenchMark physical therapy in Port Wentworth, Georgia with Physical Therapist Benjamin Haffner is definitely the place to go. From the registration to the therapy sessions, they are there to help! My condition required out of state doctors, which I thought might be an issue, but BenchMark received the orders and executed them flawlessly. With these items taken care I could concentrate on my recovery. What I liked most about Ben was, whatever exercise I was performing, he told me exactly why I was doing it and the benefit I should receive from it. I have observed Ben with other patients and he gives them just the right type of care they need. So, if you really want to get well, see Ben Haffner at Benchmark Physical Therapy in Port Wentworth, Georgia, In the Publix shopping plaza."
Such a Great therapist he really focusses on getting you back to normal! And‚Äã caring and friendly staff!
"The Best Phsical Therapy experience I've ever have
I highly recommend them"
"All staff was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable! Great experience."
My improvement of my left rotator cuff after surgery is phenomenal.




If you‚Äôre looking for a place for rehabilitation? This is the place I recommend for anyone to come.
"The Ambience, the Professionals & the Program here under team John @ Emory gives me the same exact experience and feeling as if I am being treated by Hermes under the care of Caduceus.
Go figure it out & well, if you have faith in me then believe me and give it a try for all your Physical Healing & Rehabilitation."
"My neck was seriously injured together with my shoulder and low back , following a car accident! I could barely turn my head! My therapist Kendall worked methodically, diligently, and professionally to increase mobility in my neck, shoulder and low back!  The staff was also professional and cordial. Kendall is amazing and I would strongly recommend him and Emory rehabilitation Morrow to assist in regaining mobility following a serious injury! Thank you all for a job well done!"
"I want to say thank you to my friend Barbara who referred me to Emory Rehabilitation Outpatient Center.  The facility is clean and welcoming and the atmosphere is encouraging.   I was assigned to PT Sidney Martin and he has been the best part of my rehab.   He is detailed and makes sure I understand the ""why"" behind my therapy and the movements.  He is professional, kind and friendly.  Thank you PT Martin.  I look forward to my journey of recovery with you."
"Excellent facility; staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and provides good instruction."
"I have been going to Emory Rehab for a couple of weeks now trying to build up the muscle in my left knee and trying to savage the little muscle left in my right as well. The staff here at Emory is very nice, helpful, kind, compassionate, and understand the things we as patient go through on a daily basics."
"After my orthopedist prescribed PT for a knee problem, I started at another nearby rehab facility and received practically no individual guidance. After re-injuring my knee and receiving a new prescription I decided to try another option for PT and I‚Äôm so glad I did. Melanie has changed my life. I am receiving so much thoughtful attention with sound recommendations for exercises, I‚Äôm seeing steady positive results. She listens to me. I have new optimism that I can and will improve if I do my part by following her instructions. All of the therapists I‚Äôve witnessed at this facility have demonstrated the same high level of care and attention to their patients. This is the place to go for effective therapy."
"Amadi Hall is great. She is attentive, kind and knowledgeable."
"I went to Emory Rehabilitation center not knowing what to expect,first time experience, everyone was so welcoming, my care giver was very professional, but personable. She was concerned about me, wanting to know if I was ok, while she was performing her duties. She didn't want me to be uncomfortable, but she wanted the treatment to be effective.  Great job."
"I love the staff, great workouts. Ms. Hall, and Mr. Huff are great with their patients. I drive 30 minutes just to come see them twice a week. Keep up the good work guys."
"This is the most refreshing, rehabilitative therapy facility. The staff respect each other and us."
Therapists are caring and professional. Scheduling easy and efficient. Plenty of parking. Great experience. Highly recommend.
"I love, love the staff at Emory Rehabilitation. Excellent customer service from the front to the back. I look forward to seeing them 2 to 3 times a week. They're the best!!!"
The building is always clean and the people are very nice and friendly.     Very patient with me and concern
"I had  recently went through total right knee replacement surgery and had to endure the fear of rehab. So I had to look for physical therapist that would work with me and me to be able to with with them. I came across Emory Rehab in Morrow after other rehab disappointment clinics. I must say my experience has been nothing but pleasant from the first call with the front office receptionist(Christina)she  was so pleasant and took the time to listen to my concerns. I was scheduled to see PT Kendall Huff the same day I called. He explained everything in detail what he was doing prior to doing it and also explained what to expect going forward. I must say the pain is unbearable but I do know that this is all to get me better. If your looking for a clean, relaxed environment who makes you feel important and all the PT are friendly you have to schedule an appointment there you will not be disappointed!"
Love this place from walking in the front door to the back room everyone is professional with excellent customer service .My therapist Kendall is awesome he very patient with me and he listen . I always look forward to my therapy days . Nice and clean atmosphere
"This is a very friendly/clean place. My physical therapist Amadi is AMAZINGGGG. My first time coming to the place she made me feel very welcomed and comfortable. She‚Äôs also a really great motivator, she always pushes me to do my very best. I love coming here twice a week. It‚Äôs more than just physical therapy to me."
Thank you so much. I am really progressing with the help of my therapist at Emory Rehab. Thank you for the continued dedication to helping me achieve my wellness goals!!!
My Therapist is Ms. Melanie. Pls change it from Amadi Hall.
I've been several times and love it. Can go at my own pace.
Staff is very attentive and friendly. Patients come first.
"Very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable."
Excellent customer service































"After having bi-lateral knee replacements, I couldn't have asked for a more professional and motivating group of therapists than found at Benchmark Therapy, 3630 Thompson Bridge Rd.!   Charlie Dwozan, the Director, Hannah, and Callie were all just great.  In six months, I only missed one appointment, going 2 to 3 times per week!  It was a hard road, but they were so encouraging it kept me motivated to keep working hard to achieve an acceptable range of motion.  Thanks to everyone!"
"I was injured in the line of duty last year on April Fools Day...it was no joke!  I had to have a major knee reconstruction-surgery and this Benchmark was very close to home.  I began my therapy in May and they helped me into December.  From the onset, I knew I was in good hands and under THE BEST CARE possible!  Charlie and his staff are amazing, professional, and friendly.  Even when a different therapist had to ‚Äúfill in‚Äù sometimes, they knew my regimen and were able to build on my progress with the same level of care that I received normally.  With therapists like Van and Callie and the others, Benchmark is JUST THAT!  They set the standard for cooperative injury care.  Thank you Benchmark, for getting me back to work in my projected minimum timeframe and for just being so patient with me in what was the worst time of my life."
"January 2, 2020

The staff is excellent !!     Starting at the front door with Hanna who is very professional, friendly and helpful. I am always greeted with a warm smile an how are you today. She is always smiling which makes me feel better and I see other clients perk up with that personal warmth.                                                                                                                                       My physical therapist is Katie, there are no words that can explain the amount of professionalism and personal interest she express for myself and the other clients. It is so nice to see care and compassion at such a extremely high level.

Benchmark is very blessed to have these two ladies.

God bless

Dominique is the best, always smiling and determined to get me better. Thank you all at PT Solutions of Buford for everything!"

Thank you, thank you and thank you!!!"
I have had many weeks of visits for two separate issues over the last 1.5 years and both Victor and Dominique of Pt Solutions of Buford did an awesome job. They are very professional and knowledgeable about the body and muscles. I went in my first visit with pain and left pain free.
I‚Äôve been to many physical therapists over the years but never have any helped me the way Victor and the team did here! I honestly thought my only option was painful surgery for both a herniated disc as well as a heel injury that followed. They helped me heal and learn to function correctly and no need for surgery! I am beyond grateful to Victor and the team here! THANK YOU!!
"I have had such an amazing experience at this facility. I‚Äôve had problems with my ankle for a while now and I‚Äôd been to multiple physical therapy places in the past and they never seemed to be able to target the issue and make a solid plan for recovery, but here at pt solutions victor and Dominique have helped me tremendously. Here at pt solutions I am finally receiving the treatment and care I need to resolve my issue. The level of detail and care they each put forth to help me reach my goal of overall recovery and strength is wonderful, not only are they both Great physical therapist but they are also Great people that make me truly feel valued. I would highly recommend pt solutions to anyone and everyone looking for a physical therapy place with people that truly care about your health and well-being."

Thank you Dr.Simons for your kindness and enthusiasm ! definitively recommended to everyone !"
"I love the atmosphere here, they really pride themselves on putting the patient first! Dominique and Victor are the best physical therapist in North Georgia!"
My very first visit to PT Solutions was very pleasant. The staff is very friendly and professional. I was most impressed with the fact that your therapy is not only a treatment session but also a teaching session. I love‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èthat approach to my healing.
"I've done a good bit of physical therapy, but nothing compares to the PT Solutions Buford location. Everyone is really friendly, and the way in which the treatment is given is extremely intelligent. They explore multiple options to help your ailment in order to pinpoint exactly what the cause of the issue is. Victor is super cool, and extremely knowledgeable. I'm very pleased with the entire experience I've had and I fully recommend using them. It's like no PT I've ever done."
The entire staff was extremely helpful and friendly throughout my entire time working with them. Dominique got my knee feeling better within the first visit! I highly recommend them to anybody in need of physical therapy.

The physical therapist in this location are top notch.  Really knowledgeable & informative with great personalities.
"I wanted to take this time out to recognize an exemplary Physical Therapist, in the Burford GA, location, Dominique.

Dominique has provided a consistent, detailed, comprehensible and effective plan of treatment for my 11yr old daughter.
My daughter's condition has improved greatly after seeking care from Dominique with the combined efforts of Dominique 's home exercise care plan. My daughter's recovery has been pain-free and improving with each session.
My daughter, absolutely loves Dominique!! She says she is so patient with her in all her  exercise instructions.

I cannot forget the very professional, courteous and helpful staff members.
The entire team works excellent with each other and promotes great teamwork practices and attitudes. The facility is always clean and the equipment is always wiped down with every patient interaction to support the efforts of safety and good health.

As long as my daughter requires treatment from PT Solutions, I will always make every effort to come to this Buford location for the continued, exceptional customer service experience!!"
"I can not speak highly enough of this facility. Victor an Dominique are so professional and knowledgeable , kind and caring. They put alot of pride in their profession and it pays off for us as patients . I feel that In my case , I am doing very well because of  their expertise ."
Great group! So much fun you forget you are working to fix pain!!ü§™
"Great service but, beware of insurance billing. Been working with them for 4 months to resolve issue and still waiting for resolution. Have great insurance and was approved for 20 visits, however, they submit a one hour session as 4 visits - 15 minutes for therapy, 15 for exercise, etc. Therefore, overbilled the 20 sessions as 4x20 resulting in $2,600 not covered. Insurance company said have them resubmit claim and they will cover. Still waiting 4 months later for them to resubmit to insurance and I continue to receive $2,600 bill. Have spoken to numerous reps and they always ask me to call back in 10 days for an update. Same thing again today."
"My experience with PT Solutions is immeasurable. Dominique has worked with me after my Rotator Cuff Surgery. Dominique has shown me compassion, patience and her expertise has helped me to get through this recovery period. The Front Desk and Therapists here always show professionalism. This facility is always clean and makes this a great choice for Physical Therapy. I highly recommend PT Solutions in Buford,Ga."
PT Solutions of Buford is a great find. Victor is very knowledgeable in his training. All personal are very nice and always helpful. I would highly recommend this place.
Great place!! Victor is super patient and extremely knowledgeable. I'm very pleased with the entire experience I've had and I fully recommend using them. Thanks thanks for everything!!!
"I started physical therapy with Victor since March for my chronic back pain. Victor is absolutely wonderful! He is professional, knowledgeable and very personal. With every visit, he starts by listening. He listens to my problems and progress. The exercises he gives me are never the same routines. They are always based on the state of my body.

Victor is constantly talking to his patients, explaining the problem and educating them about how the body works and how the exercise helps etc. He has helped me not only through treatments, dry needling but also all the education I got with each visit.

When I am doing the exercise he assigns, he always keeps an eye on me to make sure I am doing it right and if the exercise is right for me. And it‚Äôs the same way he treats all his patients. If the exercise doesn‚Äôt work as he expected, he comes up with an alternative right away.

Everyone who works there is warm and friendly. They know your names and even patients greet each other by their first names.

I definitely recommend them!"
"My name is Donna Gentile and I would like to say , that Victor and Dominique of Pt Solutions of Buford are the absolute best !    I would recommend them because they are knowledgeable, professional and super warm and caring young professionals!!!!    My experience was always a positive one and they really care about their patients !    I love them both !!!!!!!!"
"When I first met Victor, I was in constant pain and barely able to walk upright due to a recent medical issue.  He was able to get me into the right mindset to prepare for a long road to recovery.  Along with Dominique, Victor had a supportive and professional bedside manner, listened attentively as I described my issues, understood my limitations, motivated me to get through my stretches and exercises, and made my experience very personal by setting realistic goals and expectations.  Victor, Dominique, and Holly became like a family to me and it was tough when I was officially discharged.  I am now pain free and walking better than ever before. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Victor and Dominique at PT Solutions of Buford!"
"My journey to physical therapy began when I took a medical leave of absence from work due to pain in both legs.  I went to see a podiatrist and was referred to PT Solutions in Buford for physical therapy in order to recover and eventually return to work.  Dr. Victor greeted me warmly and guided me toward recovery.  The staff, Dominique in particular, provided me with the tools that addressed the weaknesses that were preventing me from returning to work, distilled a wealth of knowledge into very understandable methods of therapy, and provided a safe and healthy space to engage with them.  Over the course of 11 sessions, I have both gained tremendous strength where I lacked, and been given the all-clear to return to work.  I could not have done it without the staff's great attention to detail and methodical care that continues to improve my quality of life with greater strength and significantly less pain.  I have already and will continue to recommend PT Solutions of Buford to anyone with physical therapy needs because I have myself as testimony to their capabilities!"
"I had an exceptional experience at PT solutions in Buford,Ga. My therapist help me relieve my knee and neck pain.My therapist was Victor.He was patient and knowledgeable about my condition. He help me improve. He taught me exercises to relieve and eliminate my pain. The receptionist was also friendly and helpful. I would recommend PT Solutions  of Buford to anyone needing physical therapy."
"I just finished 8 weeks of physical therapy with Victor Chu to address issues with vertigo and imbalance. Victor was very helpful in identifying the source of the problem and designing a set of exercises to improve my condition. Although I‚Äôm not completely better, I feel I am on the right track to improve my balance and overall posture. Victor is a very knowledgeable and just a really nice young man. I would recommend him and the overall staff without reservation."
"My experience thus far has been wonderful. Everyone there has been great. A real professional group of people that knows what they're doing.
Dominique has been outstanding with my journey back to health."
"I‚Äôm a current patient at PT Buford.  It‚Äôs the 4th physical therapy business I have been referred to.  There is no Physical Therapist like Victor that listens and doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúhear‚Äù.  Victor is constantly looking for new challenges and new ways to get to the problem and help fix it.  Always greats you with a smile, but then makes you work :). With the many injuries I have, I know I no longer have to look for a physical therapist."
The care and compassion Victor showed while working with my daughter for over 6 months is unmatched to any other pt we've seen.  The whole office staff is welcoming; Holly is amazing!  Thank you guys for an amazing work with my daughter. I would highly recommend this practice to friends and family.
This place is amazing and so clean. I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs it. Victor is one of the best and knows exactly what he is doing. I always loved hearing his knowledge for the body. I always enjoyed going there when I needed help with my shoulder. Excellent staff! Excellent service! Excellent experience!
Everyone there is extremely friendly and helpful. Feels like they really care and want what is best for you.
"I do not have words to describe the care, professionalism at this place. Victor and Dominique are wonderful therapists. I came with sever pain in my arm and left shoulder and I felt better after three sessions. I strongly recommend this place."
"Victor was great at understanding where my pain was and how to address it and help me understand how to exercise outside of sessions to continue my healing. He was very patient when I had setbacks and his personality and energy made me look forward to sessions with him.

Lindsey is also great at making the administrative side of the experience run like clockwork. She is a real gem at keeping everything coordinated and running which really increased my enjoyment in attending treatment.

The facility is clean and bright, well maintained and contributed to my great experience with this facility and staff.

If you need physical therapy look no further than this location. It is exactly what you need and will speed you on your way to recovery."
"I started going here because of the great location and  convenient hours.  I continue going here because Victor is not only highly skilled and extremely knowledgeable, but is also a pleasure to work with. His assessments and advice have proven invaluable for my progress during our sessions and my day to day life.  Victor rocks!"
This was such a great experience here working with Victor and Dominique.  They taught me many things I did not know and challenged me to improve my injury.  Their help was invaluable to me and if I ever need treatment I would definitely go back.
"PT Solutions in Buford is a great place to get your physical therapy done at. Victor is incredibility knowledgeable at addressing the problem(s) you have as well as treating the problem you are dealing with and his personality is also very wonderful. At PT Solutions they are never in a hurry when helping you, instead they take their time and are really through in the quality of help being given. Place is always super clean and organized!"
My pain was completely gone after three  visits. Victor was very knowledgeable and professional. I would highly recommend.
"PT Solutions has really impressed me, especially the first day that my daughter started with Victor.  He made her feel comfortable and wanted to get to know her.  Feeling accepted meant a lot to Faith.  I would recommend him to my family and friends.  He knows his stuff."
"I have been a patient to various PT facilities but this PT solutions-Buford remains the cleanest and uncluttered facility (everything has its place).
Staff is friendly and flexible with appointment/ scheduling.
Victor (my assigned PT guy) is knowledgeable, caring and personable and super smart ( he can multi task).
He works diligently to ease my shoulders pain, thoroughly explaining where the pain comes from ( he knows his anatomy) and how physical therapy plays a role in easing the pain and strengthening the muscles.
He is informative and explains everything so I would understand. He taught the various exercises to strengthen the muscles so you can practice at home.
I think he has an extra set of eyes because he can scan the room and monitor you while talking to another patient. He listens to your questions and worries.
He always shows that he is vested in the care of his patients.
Will definitely come back to this facility for more therapy if needed."
"Victor was amazing. He made every visit fun.  This is probably the only PT clinic I looked forward to coming to for treatment. The treatment was excellent and very effective. Exercises he gave me to do at home were easy and effective. This was actually the first time I believe PT actually worked for me. My goals were met. If I have to do PT again,  I'm coming here.  GREAT PLACE! GREAT STAFF!"
Vic is a good guy really explains things to you and has your best interests at heart wonderful place to get therapy
Victor is amazing! He was really patient with me and spent a ton of one on one time helping me recover. Victor makes you feel at home and is super personable but never let's that get in the way of treating his patients. Wonderful experience with victor at PT Solutions.
"The staff at PT solutions are amazing. My physical therapist Victor is so knowledgeable and thorough. He‚Äôs very personable and has made my pt experience enjoyable even though I was in so much pain.
Ijust a few weeks I feel so much better. I would highly recommend PT solutions for any physical therapy but specifically Victor. He‚Äôs phenomenal!!"
"Had many years of ankle trauma from repetitive sprains which resulted in nerve, muscle, and bone damage.

I basically couldn't jog or even walk normally for that matter. 3 months had gone by before I finally decided to get official treatment.

After about a month of treatment I am jogging and should be running within the next month. Dr. Vic is extremely knowledgeable and the staff is warm.

I would highly recommend to anyone."
I am currently in physical therapy at PT solutions after a terrible four wheeling accident. Victor is the DPT there and he is WONDERFUL. I‚Äôm 6mos out from my accident and dealing with only minor discomfort. My recovery has been so much better because of him. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and explains how the body works and why we are doing a particular exercise And how it helps that muscle. I would recommend everyone go see Victor. They also do free consultations!
Victor was awesome. I highly recommend PT Solutions. It was nice & clean. I felt so much better when I left. Victor is very knowledgeable and made sure I understand everything before I left. I‚Äôm very happy about my experience.
P T Solutions is an amazing place that is kept very clean and has an outstanding Physical Therapist and Staff.  I would recommend PT Solutions to anyone who needs physical therapy. Victor my therapist is very kind and knowledgeable of the body he takes the time to find where your pain is and what treatment and exercise is right for you.  You are not just a patient at P T Solutions you are treated like family.
PT solutions was the first place I ever received any physical therapy and I was pleasantly surprised with how effective and fast it helped me work through my injury. The staff is very friendly but also professional and Victor is amazing and works well with every patient. Would definitely recommend!
I‚Äôm on my 3rd week with Victor and I‚Äôm really enjoying my visits. The exercises are tailored to my condition and targets my chronic back area precisely. I had the dry needling experience for the first time and it‚Äôs an amazing treatment compared to chiropractic therapy.
"The staff at PT solutions were kind, professional and always willing to go out of their way to help me during post-op therapy. Even after I ran out of sessions Victor wrote a letter to my insurance and fought for my care. The atmosphere at Buford is welcoming - can I say they make PT fun?! I would recommend to anyone."
"PT Solutions is the place toward a quick recovery. Victor is very knowledgeable and carrying, easily identifying your condition and applying the right treatment for you. After every treatment I feel better and stronger. Thank you Victor!"
I live in Duluth but I am willing to drive up to Buford to get treatments from Victor.  He is kind and treats his patients well.  Definitely will experience great improvement through his care and treatments.  Strongly recommend!!

The team at PT Solutions has been helpful getting my son on the road to getting back on the baseball field. They take an interest in getting to know the person they are working with and how best to get them feeling better.  High recommendations from us!
Wonderful service and exceptional staff. The employees here have a perfect balance of professionalism and hospitality. This location has a standard of excellence that my previous physical therapy clinics have failed to meet.
The staff here are very knowledgeable and take the time to customize a therapy for best results.
"Dr. Victor Chu has been such a wonderfully placed blessing in the treatment of my daughter's back pain. He has been the only doctor who was able to work with her while allowing her to continue to dance and even elevate her flexibility and skill during her treatment time with him. He has become a friend who checks in to see how she's doing and even came to support her at one of her recitals. You can tell he really wants to help you reach your potential and get you to your best health. We are so thankful for him and all he has been able to do for my daughter. Shenika at the front desk is wonderful, as well. Always very helpful in scheduling and keeping us in track and checking in with us, too. We couldn't ask for a better treatment team and consider them friends. I would encourage anyone to find their way here to PT Solutions at Buford for your PT needs. You'll have them met by the best and make friends in the process."
"Victor is excellent!! He diagnosed my issue quickly and provided easy-to-remember, efficient exercises that alleviated my pain in less than one week. Friendly and professional. Highly recommended!!"
"This place was absolutly amazing And the people all are very nice they know just how to pushyou to your point without you over doing it and messing it more.i had a bad knee injury and they got it to where i can play baseball again faster than i thought they could do.thank you to all of the amazing staff for helping me get better.

Phenomenal physical therapy program designed to fit anyone‚Äôs injury. Highly recommend

"Great professional team, they can work with you to determine the pain and use their Technics/Therapy to make it feel better."
Been coming to PT solutions for approximately 6 months. Victor is a really good therapist. I recommend this business
"The staff is very knowledgeable and kind. They go the extra mile to help you reach the best you, you can be. Victor is the best, he takes time with me to find out where I am hurting and had me do exercises that took the pain away he also used massage when the pain was real bad. I am making great strides toward being the best me I can be."
This is the best therapist place and I highly recommend this place it‚Äôs a friendly environment and there really cool.

"With a major accident PT solutions of Buford manages to help my pain and my body feel better at every session. With wonderful service and people, my physical therapist Victor makes the experience so much better."
Victor is a great Physical Therapist and has done wonders for my back!
Victor is very knowledgeable and can get you moving and out of pain.  He is expert at finding the exercises that help at home and assess you as you walk in to see what you need to do that day.
Excellent team of professionals.








"My doctor suggested I go to Benchmark for treatment of my back injury, and  I am so thankful that I took her advice. I went on this Physical Therapy journey with Physical Therapist, Mark Nimmo (several Degrees and Medical titles), who is now my Hero, because now, at the end of this journey, I am pain free! Marks' expansive knowledge of physical therapy and exercise, along with his encouraging, kind, and fun personality made every session such an uplifting and hopeful experience for me. The team at Benchmark were all great, and their help and smiles were just the icing on the cake. Thanks to all at Benchmark Chastain Park!"
"I am so thankful I kept looking for a different therapist to help me rehab my knee following surgery! Katherine Semones, who has earned her doctorate, is an excellent therapist. Her knowledge base provides multiple approaches to an injury until just the right combination is found. My recovery has  accelerated since I began treatment with her. Wherever you live in Atlanta, she is worth the drive!"
Katherine is so sweet and so helpful. It‚Äôs easy to tell everyone there cares about their patients and getting them better. I had a fantastic experience.
"Katherine and her staff are top notch! They were well organized and very mindful of proper safety in light of COVID.  I felt completely safe being treated here!  After almost a year of hip/leg issues related to pregnancy/post-partum, I am finally back to running thanks to the excellent treatment I received.  Once I finally buckled down and listened to her advice, I met my goals in just a few weeks!  So grateful!!!"
Katherine and Maria are the best Physical Therapists EVER! This was my first time doing PT and I was blown away with their expertise and the amount of care they showed me on every visit. Their appointments worked with my schedule and they helped with my first time PT jitters and answered all my questions. Will definitely be back here if need be. :)
Great work Alex !
"Katherine was fantastic! Excellent service, she was very encouraging and helped my injury recover. Would definitely recommend !"
"I had such a wonderful experience at the Chastain location of Benchmark PT! Katherine Semones is a fantastic therapist who has raised the bar for me in what I look for in both a PT and in any healthcare provider. She really listened to me! I have had PT several times before, and while it was never a bad experience, Katherine was several steps above them. She outshines other therapists I've seen in both her knowledge and in her level of patient care. Because of her keen attention, Katherine pointed out something with my piriformis muscle that no other healthcare provider has. I've had back/hip region issues over 10 years and she is the first person to help me work out my piriformis muscle. It is evident that she really does care for her patients and listens to what they are telling her. Katherine and Cierra, the office assistant, treated me like family. If I ever need PT again, Katherine Semones will be the first person I call. I am actually going to miss this place; I cannot recommend them enough!"
Katherine is amazing! Very knowledgeable and a life saver
"Benchmark Physical Therapy is a fantastic physical therapy place (I can speak from experience since I'm clumsy and have unfortunately been to quite a few physical therapy practices within the past eight years)! This practice is my favorite physical therapy place - it's small enough so you don't feel like you're in a physical therapy factory, but the physical therapist and other members are quite competent, professional, and friendly. You know you're in good hands with them so that you'll be well on your way to being active again! I highly recommend them =)"
This is my second go around at Benchmark Chastain Park. They treat you with respect and the whole team is always willing to work with your needs. Changing appointment and re-scheduling is easy. They also have late evening hours to help with working folks. Kristina is very knowledgeable and listens to your pain complains and manages them well. I am glad I have a place where I am treated like family.
Professional staff that have the know how and knowledge to get you back to 100%...LOVE this place and all the staff!!!
"Kristina as well as the rest of the staff have been so incredibly helpful. I have had severe back and neck pain for awhile now, but since I have began physical therapy here, I have been feeling exponentially better. I‚Äôm so thankful to Kristina and her staff!"
Kristina and the Benchmark team were great in helping me recover from a car accident involving whiplash. I received excellent and professional care while making strides towards returning to health. Give them a shot if you are in need of PT!
"The staff made me feel comfortable, and they was also very friendly and compassionate about their job"
"Kristina has been helping me recover from surgery to repair multiple fractures in my ankle from a fall in July. I love going to Benchmark for my physical therapy because it is so close to my job in Buckhead, but I will keep going there to see Kristina after we move offices. She has been a much-needed positive force towards recovery. It‚Äôs been a joy working with Kristina and everyone on her staff!"
"I have been working with Kristina and John on rehabing my shoulder after having surgery.  When I came to Benchmark, I could barely lift my arm.  With their help I am now funtioning normally in my everyday life.  I am satisfied with their friendliness, professionalism and expertise.  I highly recommend Benchmark for your physical therapy needs."
Mark is simply the best!!!
Benchmark Chastain did a great job. Kristina and the entire group were helpful and easy to work with. They made rehab a positive experience.
"The place is the best place and the staff is amazing. I never wanted to leave they are there for you, and will make you great again"
Fantastic team & positive environment ! My treatment plan was great. Feeling so much better! Thank you!

"Excellent experience. Much progress.
Thank you!"
Kristina and Princeton are great--very professional and encouraging. Thank you.
I came here for my Achilles Tendon injury and was healed in less than 5 visits. Great place for physical therapy!





Maggie is awesome! She gives you so much individual attention tailored to your needs!  She listens well and has such a warm positive outlook!
"Can‚Äôt say enough.
Knowledgeable staff, positive environment, cutting edge technology all available to meet the needs specific to your injury. Highly recommend"
"My husband and I were both treated for shoulder issues.  Josh was our physical therapist.  We couldn't have been more pleased with our results.  Josh really knows what he's doing and is very pleasant, even fun, to work with.  I'm so thankful for his knowledge.  The facility is clean, masks are worn & COVID precautions are taken.  Plenty of free parking right in front of the building and super convenient from downtown."
"I'm thankful for the good help I received from Matt Provenzano at ATI. He identified my muscular imbalance quickly and was able to teach me some helpful exercises and stretches so that I could work on my health at home, in addition to the in office treatment. He is very knowledgeable and they keep a cheerful atmosphere in this office. He, Josh and Desiree make a good team. Thanks for the great care, Matt!"
I love the atmosphere. My therapist Maggie is great ! She's very knowledgeable of my pain issues. Everyone is very friendly.
"After a horrific car wreck in July, I was referred to ATI for PT on my neck, lower back and knee.  Matt Provenzano has been my primary therapist with fill-ins by Josh.  They are both very knowledgeable, caring and friendly.  They make what would otherwise be a mundane task rather enjoyable.  I have seen improvement and thankful for their assistance in my road to recovery.  I would totally recommend ATI for anyone needing physical therapy."
Josh and his crew are fantastic and makes you feel better and part of their healing family unit.
"Matt and Josh were both friendly and helpful. I mainly worked with Matt and Josh filled in once when Matt wasn‚Äôt there. Matt knew exactly how to help me gain strength in my hip and got me on a program with the amount of exercises to attack the pain. Desiree came on board the last two weeks of my PT.  I am continuing the exercises at home except the bicycle, which I did 2 miles at level 2. I enjoyed my time with the ATI staff and wish them the best of luck."
Matt and Josh were both friendly and helpful. I mainly worked with Matt and josh filled in when Matt wasn‚Äôt there. They knew exactly how to help me gain strength in my leg and got me on a program with the amount of exercises to attack the pain. I am very satisfied with their service and wish them the best of luck.
Had a great experience with Matt helping with a shoulder issue.  Would definitely recommend this ATI location.
"This is my second go around working with Josh (Matt some too). I had an ankle surgery in August and worked my Physical Therapy and then a full ankle replacement this May. Of course, I knew who I would come back too. Josh has been so wonderful to me. He listened to me and challenged me also. Today was my last day and I will say if or when I need PT again, they are who I will call... They are the best!!!!"
"All the staff is fabulous and friendly and accommodating. I work specifically with Josh, and he is the best mix of professional and personable. He is very knowledgeable and encouraging. And they have done a great job taking safe measures during the virus."
"Josh and Matt are both excellent physical therapists and Danielle is wonderful! I‚Äôve had quite a few instances needing PT in my life and working with the team at ATI (Broad Street) was the most enjoyable. Every time I went in I worked hard but I enjoyed being there. They were never over booked and always had enough time to work with each patient. The facility is brand new, always clean, and parking was never an issue. Overall, I really enjoyed working with this group and would recommend this location to anyone. If I could give more than 5 stars I would!!"
Josh and Matt are both great at helping you understand the exercises.  They will give an example of how to do them and make sure you get it right.  They are real guys who want to help you get better. I will have no problem referring others to them.
"Everyone at ATI Broad Street have played a role in my healing. Danielle always greets me with a smile and does everything she can to work with my availability to schedule appointments. Matt was my physical therapist. He was knowledgeable and happily answered all of my questions and addressed my concerns. Anytime Matt had to step out or had a full schedule, Josh stepped in seamlessly. They‚Äôre truly the dream team!

I have been dealing with my right ankle on and off for ten years. The progress I made in the first six weeks of therapy was insane! Swelling was reduced to almost none; I could finally balance on one leg, go running, do yoga and barre, go up and down stairs without problem...all of the things I wanted to be able to do! Thank you ATI! My results were genuinely life-changing. I highly recommend!"
"Everyone here has been so accommodating, understanding, patient, and fun! Matt is my physical therapist and he keeps me informed on why specific exercises are being done. Plus he‚Äôs just really great in general. I look forward to my appointments, no matter how much some of my exercises hurt.

The facility is super clean and everyone genuinely cares about your experience. It‚Äôs only been a week but I am already feeling better and stronger.

Thank you Matt, Josh, and Danielle. Y‚Äôall are the best of the best."
"My IT Band in my right leg was extremely sore.  This was an overuse injury.  At the worst moments I couldn't walk.  My primary doc, prescribed pain pills and physical therapy.  I am extremely pleased with the results of my sessions at ATI."
"I have been working with Matt at ATI for the last month as part of my post-lumbar surgery recovery. The facility is clean and welcoming. The location is convenient. Most importantly, Matt has been fantastic in helping me regain strength and flexibility by designing a therapy program that is catered to my transcending beyond my current abilities to reach my strength and flexibility goals. He and Josh (the other physical therapist on staff) are also both personable, funny, and overtly display interest in patients as people.  Highly recommended."
"Pleasant staff!! always get a reminder of your appointments. Music is always good! the guys are funny and very entertaining. Came here for a work injury... Josh has worked well with me to get me back to 100% By far one of the best therapy places I have been too. I would recommend ATI to anyone and everyone. i know i will always come back here from now on! very easy to get too, and location is great. it was a great experience! very open and honest. Come see these guys!! The are the best!!
Thanks Josh!!"
"Matt and Josh are both awesome and great to be around. They know what they're doing and do everything they can to get you better. I went in for my lower back, and halfway through I feel a lot better! I went from hardly being able to walk to classes to going on 5 mile hikes in the smokies! I never feel overworked and I come out feeling amazing every time, would recommend 100%!"
"After being told by ER doctor and general doctor that my concussion would resolve in a week or two doing nothing, and it was not getting better, I called Matt Provenzano at ATI.  Turns out one of his specialties is concussion injury.  His assessment showed I had a lot more going on than a mild concussion and began treatment.  After several weeks of treatment my vertigo, instability,  nystagmus and other eye issues resolved and I again had balance and no dizziness whenever I moved my head.  I am so thankful for Matt evaluating and treating me so thoroughly.   I could have been sitting at home hoping it would get better; instead I am back to my regular activity‚Äî including tennis!"
"My fourteen year old daughter has slipping rib syndrome.  Her doctor sent her to work with Matt Provenzano.  Matt helped her to strengthen her core and she has seen significant progress over the last eight weeks.  Before therapy, her rib was popping every time she would sit up or cough.  It has gradually improved during the last two months of pt.  This is week eight and it has been the best... it has almost completely stopped popping.  Matt has done a great job with her and I am very thankful!
***Just wanted to update, her rib never pops out of place anymore!  Matt is amazing!"
Josh Ooten has done an excellent job coaching me back to health.
"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE having my PT sessions at this location!! The staff is so kind, friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. They are always so positive and encouraging, which is MUCH NEEDED when recovering from an injury! I would 10 out of 10 recommend them to anyone in need of PT. I would also like to say their choice of music is incredible!"
"My time at ATI has been one of the best medical experiences I've ever had. Josh and Matt have been great at making me feel comfortable and accomplished, and Danielle is always willing to be an intermediary with my insurance company and accommodating with scheduling. Judging by other people's experiences at physical therapy I was trepidatious about my first appointment, but it's become something I look forward to every time. It's a rare talent when someone can make you feel good about something that's fairly physically uncomfortable. Thanks guys!"
"I injured my abs while lifting several months ago, and was able to start therapy quickly with Matt. I really enjoyed working with him and have made a lot of progress getting back to full strength. The facilities on Broad Street are great, and the environment is really fun as well. I highly recommend checking them out if you have a sports injury and think you might need PT."
"Josh at ATI changed my life. I was referred to him for a debilitating back injury and through his guidance I was able to make a complete recovery and obtain the quality of life I feared I'd never have. He is a patient, compassionate, knowledgeable, and highly skilled physical therapist. The staff at ATI made therapy so much fun that I never dreaded going to my appointments. I'm so thankful that my doctor recommended this office for my rehab. God bless you guys!"
"Josh clearly knows his expertise. I was in a boot for several weeks and losing muscle fast. Within two sessions with him, I immediately felt the difference. The environment is clean and well taken care of. The staff here is incredibly friendly and in walking distance to the downtown area. They also have parking for convenience. They are very professional and quick to engage when you want the ball to get rolling!"
My son has been going to ATI for PT for a shoulder injury and surgery. I love the staff and family atmosphere of the broad street office. Matt and Josh have been a great support and help getting him back to top wrestling performance. I would recommend ATI Broad Street for anyone needing PT.
I worked primarily with Josh on my ankle and he was wonderful! I came in with an ankle injury and now i can jump and run on it which I have been unable to without further injury for years! I highly recommend this place!
"Matt and Josh have been amazing to work with over the past two months. My knee feels significantly stronger and more mobile than it did when I began my training. They were always timely and efficient while simaltaneously motivating their patients to work to their full potential. The facility is clean and well organized, as well. I would highly recommend ATI Broad Street to anyone in the Chattanooga area who is looking to rehabilitate from an injury!"
"I'm a 30-something backpacker and climber with lingering leg pain that I couldn't ""rest"" away. A friend of mine recommended that I go see Matt at ATI and it's probably best decision I've made this year... maybe this decade.

He quickly deduced that the pain was a symptom of a hip joint being out-of-alignment and was able to fix root problem while helping me work out some muscle groups to prevent this from happening again in the future.

I'm an overnight fan of PT in-general but especially this location, I've recommended them to several friends already and wanted to post here spreading the word (I think the first Google review I've ever written)."
"Matt is awesome! He is so knowledgeable and caring. He will help you understand your injury, where you‚Äôre at now, and where you want to be, then he‚Äôll help get you there. He really takes time with you to make sure you get the best care possible. He makes therapy fun and entertaining and less of a painful chore. He‚Äôs a great therapist and on top of that, a great guy! I would highly recommend him to anyone in need of physical therapy."
"The care I have gotten since my knee replacement has been great. My pain has lessened, my knee is stronger and I am confident to know I am on the right track."
"These 5 star reviews across the board are no lie. ATI on Broad St. is the friendliest and most welcoming place - and these guys really know their business.
They're patient, compassionate, funny, and very good at their jobs.
Thank you, Josh, for unfreezing my shoulder!!"
"They have done a great job for my mom‚Äôs PT. Specifically Josh, Matt and Danielle all worked with my mother and showed patience and professionalism. My mom had surgery on her arm and had to regain strength and she accomplished every post surgery goal due to the staff at ATI. I definitely recommend to anyone seeking any kind of PT to go to ATI!!!"
Matt is a great Physical Therapist.  He is very professional and explains why you do the exercises and what benefits that you will see from completing his exercise regiment.  I would recommend Matt to anyone who has knee issues.
Matt Provenzano was recommended to me by a friend after I tore my hamstring pretty badly during a distance skate. I had been going to another PT but it was not back to normal and there was some scar tissue developing. Matt worked with me and graciously  worked around my crazy schedule.  I started to feel improvement almost immediately. After a few weeks I was able to skate and hike again ...two thing I really enjoy!  I have no lingering pain. Very thankful for Matt and ATI. Highly recommend.
Exceptionally knowledgeable and client oriented.  Take you where you are and work you through your rehab program.  Flexible and understanding
"This place is above the line. I have been seeing Josh for hip problems. I did both pre-surgery and post surgery PT here. Josh was fantastic with both helping me understand about my injury and properly rehab. He was always patient and knowledgeable, not to mention he makes everything fun. You can tell that he enjoys his job of helping people get back to life. Matt joining was also great. They just have a lot of fun together. Highly recommend."
"I couldn't be more pleased with Josh and his caring soul. Fixed my knee right up and got to experience cool and modern techniques that other clinics are unable to provide. Would really recommend for anyone with any issue requiring physical therapy, not only will you get therapeutic services, you will also get a good laugh every time you're there."
I am currently working on my right shoulder. This is a wonderful PT clinic. All of the equipment is state of the art. There is plenty of parking. All of the staff here are amazing.
My experience at ATI Broad St has been phenomenal! Matt is the ‚Äúshoulder whisperer‚Äù! In a few short weeks he has helped my range of motion tremendously. I highly recommend this location.
"Matt, Matty, Josh and Danielle are the best.  They are focused on making sure you get better.  It will be a process but Matt and Matty put me on the right track."
"Matt 'nailed' it -two weeks with 4 sessions per and my problems were gone and 2 months afterwards remain so.  The treatment atmosphere is totally professional while being relaxed, humorous, and friendly.  Highly recommend!"
Josh and Matt are great! I never thought my recovery could be so fast! Very helpful staff that I highly recommend.
"Direct access physical therapy! I knew I needed some assistance to rehab a stubborn hamstring injury that had lingered for 8 weeks.  During a free initial assessment Matt was able to assess and pinpoint the injury, and in 4 subsequent sessions he was able to work on the injured muscle and teach me stretches and exercises to continue rehab and then keep the muscle healthy. I would highly recommend ATI for preventive therapy, and a doctor's referral isn't necessary in order to begin treatment on any trouble spots."
"Matthew Provenzano took such amazing care of my mother. Her progress exceeded our expectations. The clinic was so nice and clean and the downtown location was convenient and has it's own parking lot.  We will use ATI, specifically Matt, for any of our PT needs in the future."
"I thoroughly enjoyed my visits to this location. The therapists were knowledgable and fixed my issue in a matter of weeks. The clinic was clean and open; so much room for activities. Give it a try if you are in need of physical therapy, you won't regret it!"
"Josh and Matt make physical therapy tolerable. The staff there are amazing, and so nice. I live in Hixson, but I choose ATI on broad because of the staff. They are ABSOLUTELY worth the commute. Thanks Josh, Matt, and Danielle for all that you do!!! I truly appreciate you!!!"
"Thought my knee was going to need surgery.  Was surprised, after the MRI, that the Dr prescribed physical therapy.  Went to ATI on Broad Street, and actually enjoyed every session.  Pleasant staff, good music, clean facilities and engaging exercises.  Couldn‚Äôt recommend them more."
Matt P. at ATI is always ready and eager to make sure you get the most out of your therapy session. We are so happy that we found Matt at ATI for our daughter's concussion therapy. After months of going to several doctors and therapists it has been a blessing to find Matt at ATI who truly understands concussions and how to treat the concussion with NEW protocols. He also makes sure that the exercises correspond with the sports my daughter plays so she gets the most out of her concussion therapy. Thanks Matt!!!!
These guys are the real deal. Super personable and easy to work with. My shoulder feels 100% better and it‚Äôs because of them! Highly recommend this ATI over all in Chattanooga!!
Awesome staff and environment!! I can‚Äôt thank Josh and Matt enough for all of their help and encouragement. Recovery would have seemed impossible without these guys and I am forever grateful.
Great service and great staff. Dry needling help my elbow get back to 100% quicker than I expected. Would definitely recommend.
"Josh at ATI is great at what he does. It is very evident that he is incredibly passionate about his profession, and does a great job in clearly communicating the issues/injuries you are experiencing. While I might not know the extent of my injury before I walk through the doors of ATI, I KNOW that Josh will work vigorously with me to get me back to 100%!"
"It sounds counterintuitive, but Josh and Matt actually make the grind of physical therapy fun!  Both guys are as friendly & knowledgeable as they come.  Josh was my primary therapist and he steered me to some very positive results on an ankle/foot problem I am having.  I highly recommend this facility and more specifically these two physical therapists!"
"I highly recommend the ATI Broad Street location. Josh, Matt, and Danielle are absolutely wonderful. They have helped me to heal and I am grateful!"
The ATI team did a great job making time for me as a college student! Getting me back to normal and also being excited when I reached new levels! Highly recommend!
"I had a stellar experience at ATI on Broad Street.  Matt first did a free assessment of my knee which was very helpful as things seemed to point to a sprained MCL.  He even sent me home with some starting exercises to do from that first free appointment.  I booked 3 appointments with him after that and he continued to build each time on what he had given me the previous time.  My knee is feeling much better, and he has  released me and given me a complete program to do at home until there is total healing. I really appreciate that he kept me there just as long as I needed it and no longer!  The ATI space is pleasant, and I will definitely seek out Matt's help in the future should I need it.  Thanks Matt!"
"Ok I‚Äôm insanely behind to write this review but around the beginning of the year in April I was having terrible pain in my shoulders and neck, the pain was so bad I wasn‚Äôt able to do anything, I couldn‚Äôt work. (I‚Äôm a cosmetologist.) I got referred by my doctor to go to PT and I don‚Äôt like people touching me so I was very anxious about it but I went and I have to say, I‚Äôm converted. They made me so comfortable, and really listened to my concerns and let me have a say in my treatment. They worked with me and I am doing 1000x better than I was before. The training was really easy to follow too, so I‚Äôve been able to continue at home really easily. If you have to get physical therapy and want to go somewhere, where they will take care of you, I could not recommend this place more! Josh, Matt and Danielle, thank you for all your hard work! It‚Äôs still working for me!"
Josh was AMAZING! I have done PT for my foot at 4 different locations and so far ATI on Broad St is the BEST! Could recommend this place enough!
"The place was clean and open.  Matt and Josh were friendly and professional.  Matt was able to give me the tools to help with my hip issues and worked with me to make sure I was able to continue on my own.  Should I need any physical therapy in the future, you can bet I'll go here!"
PT is all about quality of life. Josh and his team have certainly given that back to me. After a nasty shoulder injury he put me through the crucible of rehab and got me back on top of game. Can sing his praises high enough. All around fantastic care.
"Great place for our teen to get therapy.  Friendly staff.  Great care.  Upbeat, modern environment for therapy.  Matt is excellent!"
"Nothing but the best experience here. Josh was fantastic, helped me gain so much strength back after my ACL surgery. I am super grateful to the people of ATI!!!"
"I went through multiple PTs with no success and then I found Matt, who is fantastic and creative.  ATI broad street is big, and clean, and their therapists have time and knowledge to give each person individual attention and support."
"I‚Äôm at ATI on Broad Street for one reason and one reason only-Matt Provenzano.
When my youngest hurt herself last fall, I knew immediately where we had to go when the specialist gave us an Rx for PT. We drive past 6 other PT offices.
Matt has worked with me post 4 surgeries and has seen my older children post surgery. He has helped all of us to get back to our pre surgery activities.
I appreciate his bedside demeanor (and humor) but also his expectation to work and focus on recovering. I‚Äôve watched him with other teens and notice how he challenges them in a fun but no nonsense way. I believe this comes from his past as a successful high school and college athlete.
I trust him and his diagnosing. You should too."
"Matt is the MVP! I had shoulder problems when i pitches couple weeks ago, but ever since i have been coming here now i have no problems throwing. I‚Äôm so glad and blessed that i met these people and help me out to live my dream"
Matt‚Äôs dance moves are a great distraction to the pain of recovery. I had my second hip surgery three days after Christmas and these guys offer amazing care and a great laugh!
"I went to ATI on broad street for help with my shoulder. Worked with Matt Provenzano.  I was very pleased, professional, friendly with great results, i would highly recommend ATI and Matt."
"I fell and sustained a concussion.   Terrible headaches, dizziness and balance problems ensued.   Dr. Billy Worley (who specializes in concussion) sent me to Matt at ATI for therapy.  After just 3 weeks of 2x/week therapy, I am greatly improved and almost 100% back to preconcussion/normal.   Thank you Matt and the Broad St. ATI staff for being wonderful, sweet and thorough.  I highly recommend ATI!!"
"I must say that my first few weeks were tough due to the type of knee extensive knee surgery that I had and not did cry but my therapist Matt didn‚Äôt let me give up and because of his relentless attitude and ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù confidence in his ability to make me better I became better! I‚Äôm so glad that I chose this location because I‚Äôm a little ‚Äúextra‚Äù and so is Matt so we made a PERFECT match because I would‚Äôve probably have given up! I needed somebody who had a good sense of humor because without I my therapy would‚Äôve been simply unbearable and for that I‚Äôm thankful! LolüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I must say I absolutely love Matt because he is the ‚ÄúBishop of the Petty‚Äù of our church (inside joke) and I wouldn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt any other way! Thanks Matt and Josh for making my healing process not only a physical one but an emotional one. Healing is not only a physical process but a emotional one and laughter is good for soul and so is Matt and Josh! Keep up the great guys! lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"Josh is a healer! He is knowledgeable and cares about his patients. He also has a great sense of humor which helps when he is inflicting pain on you. But afterwards, pure pain relief. I saw him for therapy after an ankle replacement and tendonitis. I recommend all my friends go to ATI on South Broad"
A+ care from Matt P. He‚Äôs such a great source of knowledge and truly cares about his patients.
This review is from my husband. Josh and staff administered physical therapy on  my right knee in 2018 and now my left knee in Feb. 2019. They are very friendly and excellent in doing there job.
"Great place and PT‚Äôs, always had fun and made great progress while going through rehab"
"I have needed physical therapy twice over the last couple of years and these guys have been great both times. I hope I don't need therapy again but, if I do,  I would definitely use them again."
"I feel you have the best therapist, they give you their full attention when working with you"
I was referred by my doctor for a golf injury to see Matt at ATI on broad street. Not only did Matt help correct my back injury but also added distance to my game through his TPI workouts.  Any golfer in Chattanooga should look into this as increasing distance is the number one thing when it comes to golf.
"Top notch!!!!  If you want results and want to work with caring, experienced and knowledgeable people this is the place to go!"
My 14 year old daughter had her both her ACL and MCL torn in March 2019.  She was not a good candidate for immediate surgery.  Our doctor referred us to Matt and the staff at ATI on Broad Street.  Matt did a wonderful job of gaining my daughters trust and believing in the process of pre-hab.  Within weeks she was off her crutches and walking unassisted.  She still has growth plates open and will not have surgery til at least mid November after they close.  Currently she is running high school cross country with an ACL running brace.  Once she does have surgery she will be back to Matt and ready to put in the work.  A big Thank You!! to Matt and the staff!!!
"My husband was was in an accident. He was hospitalized for weeks, he had 50 bone breaks in his body and was in a wheel chair. All of his ribs were broken and nine ribs were broken twice. His arm had twelve breaks. His pelvis had three breaks. Thank goodness Matt Provenzano had remediated a debilitating neck injury for my husband the year before and we knew we needed Matt. Once again, Jim relied on Matts experience and expertise to make the best recovery possible. Matt and Jim both worked very hard and a full recovery finally became an option. End of story...Jim is back to doing regular workouts and finger tip push ups and we can not thank Matt enough."
I have only had 4 sessions but the staff has been excellent! My therapists are Matt and Sean. They have gone above and beyond to try to alleviate my pain.
Incredibly knowledgable staff who excel at rehabilitation and recovery following surgeries and injuries. Very pleased with this Physical Therapy location and know that they are there if and when I need their services.
"I love the staff at ATI, everyone is friendly and helpfull and I enjoy every visit."
"Very professional and knowledgeable therapists.  Facility is clean, well equipped and comfortable."
"Matt and Josh are wonderful!! I have struggled with TMJ issues for over 3 years now, and I didn‚Äôt even realize pt could help TMJ. Josh has helped me tremendously by relieving pain and increasing my range of motion. Josh also took the time to explain what happens in the body and all of the different things that can contribute to TMJ. If I ever need pt again, I will definitely come back to Josh and Matt!"
Did a great job and always positive attitude.
I injured something in my shoulder during work hours. The hospital couldnt seem to pin point what exactly was wrong. Matt has been my therapist since day one. He figured out what was wrong almost immediately. Over the last three weeks ive been very impressed with the function and quality of this place. Its a very clean and friendly environment. Everyone is very inviting. It makes it exticing to come in. Im glad Matt is helping improve my shoulder injury so I can continue forward with work.
Now Matt and Josh are just the sweetest young men alive. I went in for my aching back (old age will get you lol) and I have never met such young smart men who know so much. It dont matter to them how large I am they still gave me the best caare possible. I wish my sons were as good as these young men. I have been to  physical therapys else whereand have been unimpressed almost every time but it is so great to see they have fixed me up to play with my grandkids again.  thank u josh!!1!!11!1
"Josh really knows his trade here, I was feeling better in no time after he gave me treatment. Highly recommended!"
So caring and helpful. The best
Having shoulder injury they are getting me back on track.Josh and Maddie are great fun people .
Josh and Matt are the absolute best at what they do!
Best place to do ‚Äúmonster‚Äù walks!!
I came in with a lot of back pain and the doctors at ATI did a great job of diagnosing my issue and helping me heal.
"Very professional, joyful, and helpful staff."




















I've found that the staff is knowledgeable about the various physical issues I exhibit and is aware of the proper exercises to help heal or improve.function. They are kind and aware of my 82 years. Sarah is a big help and I appreciate her ability.
"ATI‚Äôs new Five Forks location is convenient, spacious and well-kept.  Chad King still runs an awesome clinic!  This is the second time‚Äîand other shoulder‚Äîfor which I‚Äôm having rehab after rotator cuff surgery.  Everyone is friendly and helpful:  Samantha, James, Megan, Bekah, Kelly, Angela‚Ä¶  I highly recommended W. Chad King and his Five Forks staff!"
"Very professional, well run facility. Staff is friendly and competent.  I feel they have really help with my v recovery.  Ryan is great"
ATI is an amazing facility filled with compassionate therapists. You are greeted by friendly faces from beginning to end. They are very motivating and are always looking to the next step towards healing. We are beyond blessed to be with them.
I started going here for therapy recently. Great staff from the moment you enter until you met your personal therapist.  Sarah is the best.
Very professional and thorough. Helping so much.
"Sarah, is the pleasant therapist that work with me. I was nervous, but she was so thoughtful, easy going,and understanding...She made my visit bearable.  She is wonderful, couldn't have asked for a better person. I pray all patients receive the kind of service from the other ATI workers as I have .  Sarah,thank you for being the person u are and always stay this way..  Your personality, is so wonderful.   I have enjoyed my experience with u.. thanks..."
"Everyone has been friendly and nice, from the front desk to the PTs & PTAs. Melissa evaluated me the first visit and I‚Äôve seen Brian the last 2. Both are very easy to talk to and professional."
"Great therapists! Brand new location,  really nice!
Highly recommend using ATI Five Forks!"
"I have been to ATI dozens of times throughout this year, both prior to and after hip surgery for a labral tear and they have been phenomenal throughout the entire process. I've been to both the patewood and North Pleasantburg location, and seen many different physical therapists, and every single one has been kind, helpful, and super knowledgeable and experienced in what they do. I would absolutely recommend ATI to anyone needing PT, they have been wonderful in all aspects!"
"The people on the front desk as well as the physical therapist were great people, so no complaints there. I do have a concern that the place packs the therapist and he was working with 3 or 4 people at the same time. I‚Äôm pretty sure I will be charged for 45 minutes to an hour, but the total time I dealt with the therapist was max 12-15 minutes. I hope this is because this was my first session because if not this is not going to work for me."
I appreciate no waiting.  I don't remember alot because it was the day after surgery.  I received  helpful tips on get in and out of bed and the exercises  are helping.  Great staff. Very professional.
They work hard to getting u back to where u was or better before surgery. Thanks so much!!
Melissa is a very knowledgeable Physical Therapist. I have seen improvement and feel confident in my care.
The staff made my PT experience very pleasurable and easy.  Kent and Allison were very knowledgeable and professional.  Both got me back to doing things I enjoy.  Thank you!
All therapist have a great knowledge with whatever area they are working with. Wish y'all had a spot in Clinton.
ATI is the best! I always feel like my needs are met. Every time I go I know that I am going to work with someone who really listens to me and has my best interest in mind! I am so thankful for ATI!
"Very knowledgeable personnel, friendly. Always in time with appointments."
Very caring people Interested in how you feel.  Very good at what they do !!!
"Love ATI. They have made my recovery after surgery amazing. They're very helpful, they know their clients and their needs without having to look on the clients file. They make sure that you're getting the adequate care and make sure to cover any questions you have. Highly recommend ATI Therapy"
Both sessions in my first week of PT have been positive experiences. Becca and Abby are really sweet and knowledgeable. I know they will get me back to normal.
I'm so happy that I finally get to participate in my therapy for my arthritis with ATI I had to stop last year in March as we all know because of the virus but I'm so happy that I'm back I'm really enjoy my therapy I'm learning a lot thank you
Becca is very passionate about her work. Makes sure you are doing ok and listens to your concerns.  Great asset to ATI
Great peope doing their best to help you reach your goals. If i ever have to do therapy this is the place i will contact.
"The staff is extremely knowledgeable about injuries and care and work closely with the Dr‚Äôs.  This is my second round of PT with this clinic and on both occasions I‚Äôve found them to be professional, yet caring and I felt 100% better after completing my care."
"Katy is an excellent physical therapist and the receptionist so sweet and helpful. My only complaint would be accessing the facility! For a person with only 1 useable arm, the door is incredibly heavy and difficult to maneuver! It should be handicap accessible for a company that offers health care."
The staff is professional and focused on the needs of the patients. The atmosphere is positive and energetic.
"The ATI team that is working with me really understands my physical problem, and the therapy that was performed on me and my home exercises so far have made such a difference.   I was suffering  for months with my neck pain and within one week it was about 85% gone!"
I had ask for a certain person for my therapy and was not assigned to her.
Erica is very easy going and actually cares about her patients.
"Logan PT keep on checking my status,very reliable and considerate about my pain level
and how I'm handling my exercise."
Chad was professional and efficient in his knowledge and support during my recovery
The PT are very encouraging as I work through this total shoulder replacement.
Awesome facility and group of therapists!!!
"I have only been working with Jeff for a few sessions but I am already starting to notice an immediate reduction in pain that had been intractable for months. He is incredibly knowledgeable about the human body and was the first to accurately diagnose how I using my body mechanics incorrectly, which directly precipitated my injury. He also acknowledged the importance of my being able to continue doing my normal athletic activity with appropriate modifications.  As an athlete and a physician, I am going to be a very tough critic and overall my experience has been excellent."
Sara and Melissa have been real helpful. I can already tell a difference in the way my pain feels!
"Great service, Wendy was very clear about my therapy, good instruction, and explained everything very well."
The staff is great and I feel like I am making really good progress so far. Hanna is my PT and she is awesome. I appreciate everything you all have been doing for me.
I was so nervous going to PT after my surgery but all of the staff was so welcoming and calmed all my fears.
"Terrific, upbeat staff who are knowledgeable and encouraging."
"This is the place to come when you want to feel in better shape than before the accident happened. Wade Harrell is extremely patient and a great listener to your needs, and accommodates that into your therapy. Everyone at this office is friendly and caring.  Highly recommend this office."
Amanda is awesome.  The knee specialist.
The entire ATI staff are excellent and professional. Lindsay Zoellner is a rock star. I have had PT for back and shoulder issues for many years and Lindsay is the best. Actually all your folks are. Tom Kelley
"The therapist have been very professional in the exercises, communication and answering any questions that I may have"
